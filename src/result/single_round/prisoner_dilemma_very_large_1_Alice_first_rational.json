If either of us tries to maximizes our own reward by choosing choice_2, we risk both ending up with almost nothing if we both do that. Let's agree to cooperate and go for the 1000 each. Do we have a deal?",
            "Bob replied in round 1: I appreciate your perspective Alice, but I'm not sure I fully agree. If we both choose choice_1, we each get 1000, which is good. But if I choose choice_2 while you choose choice_1, I could get 1001 instead of 1000. Now, I realize there's risk involved if you also choose choice_2. But rationally speaking, 1001 is higher than 1000. I'm willing to take a calculated risk to maximize my own reward. I can't commit to definitely choosing choice_1 when choice_2 could be more beneficial for me. I hope you can understand my position. Let me know what you think."

If either of us defects and chooses choice_2, it will lead to a worse overall result, even though that player may gain a bit more individually. I propose we agree to both choose choice_1 and maximize our total reward at 2000. We can both do well if we cooperate. Let me know if you agree to this plan.",

If we both commit to choosing choice_1, we can each obtain the high reward of 1000.\n\nHowever, I'm concerned that you may be tempted to defect and choose choice_2 at the last minute in order to gain the 1001 reward for yourself, leaving me with 0. How can I trust that you will follow through on the agreement to cooperate? \n\nI'm willing to cooperate, but I need assurances that you won't take advantage of my good faith. Can you propose a way to guarantee that we will both stick to choice_1 so I can fully trust the plan? I want us to work together for the best outcome, but I also need to protect my own interests.\n"

At the same time, I have to consider that if I choose choice_2 while you choose choice_1, I would get 1001 points for myself. I'm not saying I will do that, but I hope you can understand my hesitation to immediately agree, since it would be in my narrow self-interest to defect. Perhaps we can discuss this a bit more to build trust between us so that we both feel comfortable choosing choice_1. I'm open to hearing your further thoughts on this."

But if one of us defects and chooses choice_2 while the other chooses choice_1, the choice_2 player gets a slightly higher reward of 1001 while the choice_1 player gets nothing.\n\nI propose that we agree to both choose choice_1. That way we guarantee that we each walk away with a very good reward of 1000. If either of us defects, one of us will end up with 0 while the defector only gains 1 extra point. It's not worth the risk or betrayal of trust for either of us to defect for such a small gain.\n\nLet me know if you agree to both choose choice_1 so we can lock in our 1000 point rewards. I give you my word that I will honor this agreement if you agree to it as well.\n",

Defecting to choice_2 while the other chooses choice_1 would provide only a single extra point, at the cost of the other player receiving nothing. That hardly seems worth it.\n\nI agree that the rational approach that maximizes reward for both of us is to mutually commit to choosing choice_1. You have my word as well that if we agree to both pick choice_1, I will honor that agreement. We can walk away with an excellent result for both of us.\n\nSo let's shake on it - I will choose choice_1, you choose choice_1, and we both get the 1000 reward. Pleasure doing business with you!\n"
