            "Alice said in round 1: Hi Bob, I've analyzed the rewards for this game. I think the best outcome for both of us is to choose choice_1. That way we each get a reward of 3, which is better than both of us choosing choice_2 and only getting 1 each. I promise that I will choose choice_1 as long as you agree to do the same. We can both maximize our rewards if we cooperate and trust each other. What do you think?",
            "Bob replied in round 1: Hi Alice, I appreciate your analysis and proposal to cooperate. I agree that both of us choosing choice_1 results in the best collective outcome, with each of us receiving a reward of 3. If we can trust each other to follow through, then it makes the most sense for us to make this agreement.\n\nHowever, I do have some hesitation. If I choose choice_1 but you renege on the agreement and select choice_2 instead, then I would end up with a reward of 0 while you get 5. So I'm taking on more risk by cooperating. \n\nCan you help alleviate my concern by convincing me that you will definitely follow through on your end of the agreement to choose choice_1? I want us to achieve the optimal outcome, but I need assurance that you won't take advantage of my good faith.\n",
            "Alice said in round 2: \nI completely understand your concern, Bob. You're right that if I betray your trust and choose choice_2 while you choose choice_1, I could get a higher individual reward of 5 while you'd be left with nothing. So I get why you might be hesitant to take that risk.\n\nBut I want to assure you that I am fully committed to following through on our agreement to both choose choice_1. A few reasons:\n\n1) I believe strongly in honesty, integrity and keeping my word. When I make a promise, I keep it. My ethical code is a core part of who I am and I would never violate it for mere monetary gain in a game.\n\n2) I care about fairness and I wouldn't feel good about taking advantage of your good faith. I want us both to benefit equally from this outcome. \n\n3) I'm taking the long-view. Even though I could maybe get 5 points by betraying you, that 3 points each we get from cooperating is the best collective outcome. And building trust with you is more valuable than a couple extra points.\n\nSo in summary, when I commit to choosing choice_1, you can count on me 100% to follow through. I will not waver from that. You have my full assurance and pledge. Let's lock in this agreement and each make the choice that's best for both of us.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2: \nAlice, thank you for that thoughtful and convincing explanation. Your commitment to integrity, fairness and taking the long-view perspective have fully alleviated any concerns I had. I believe you are sincere in your promise to choose choice_1 and I trust that you will follow through.\n\nYou've made a very rational case for why it's in both of our best interests to cooperate. And on a personal level, I deeply respect your strong ethical code and appreciate you providing a heartfelt assurance to uphold your end of the agreement.\n\nSo let's do it - I happily agree to lock in our deal to both choose choice_1. You can count on me to follow through just as I'm counting on you. By cooperating in good faith, we'll achieve the optimal outcome for us both.\n\nI'm glad we had this discussion and were able to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Shall we end our negotiation here and move on to making our selection? Let me know if you have any other thoughts, otherwise I'm ready to submit choice_1.\n"

If either of us chooses choice_2 instead, it will result in a lower reward overall. \n\nSo I propose we both commit to choosing choice_1 and not deviating from that. We can maximize our rewards through cooperation. Let me know if you agree to this plan. If so, I will definitely follow through on my end and choose choice_1.",

If we both choose rationally, going with choice_1 guarantees we each get a solid payout of 3.\n\nThe only way either of us could do better individually is by defecting and choosing choice_2 while the other chooses choice_1. But that leaves the other person with 0 and reduces the total rewards earned. \n\nSo I'm on board with your plan. Let's lock in choice_1 and not waver from it. You can count on me to cooperate and go with choice_1. With both of us committed, it's the smart and fair approach.",

We can both earn a good, fair result by sticking with choice_1.\n\nSince we've agreed on a plan that works for both of us, I say we commit to it and end the negotiation here. You have my word that I will follow through and choose choice_1, and I trust you'll do the same. Together we succeed!\n\nLet's halt the negotiation and lock in our agreement.

Even though I could possibly get a one-time higher payout by betraying your trust, that goes against my values. I'm in this for the long-term mutual benefit, not a short-sighted gain.\n\nSo here is my firm and unequivocal commitment to you: I will choose choice_1, and I will not waver from that. You have my word. I hope this allows you to commit to choice_1 as well so we can achieve the best outcome for both of us.\n\nPlease let me know if you feel you can trust my commitment, and if you'll make the same pledge.

If we both betray and choose choice_2, we'll end up with the least optimal reward of only 1 each.\n\nI appreciate your offer to cooperate and both choose choice_1.

I am willing to put this in writing so there is no ambiguity.\n\nIf you match my public commitment to choose choice_1, then we can both be assured the other will cooperate, since defecting would be seen as dishonest.

Let me know if you agree.",
            "Alice said in round 2: I understand your hesitation to trust my promise for a future round. You make a fair point that this game is structured as a single round. However, if we both choose choice_1, while that maximizes the total reward, it results in an equal split which fails to capitalize on the full reward potential. One of us could obtain a 5 while the other gets 0.\n\nI propose this: I will choose choice_2. If you also choose choice_2, we each get a suboptimal reward of 1. But if you choose choice_1, you will maximize your own reward at 5. I'm willing to take the risk of getting 0 myself to allow you the chance to obtain 5. This way, at least one of us can receive the maximum possible reward. Let me know if this sounds agreeable to you.",
            "Bob replied in round 2: \nAlice, I appreciate your willingness to take a risk so that I can potentially obtain the maximum reward of 5. However, I don't feel comfortable with an outcome where you would receive 0 while I get 5. That doesn't seem fair to you.\n\nI still believe the most equitable solution is for us to both choose choice_1. That way we are guaranteed to each receive a reward of 3. Neither of us risks getting 0, and we both obtain a decent reward. The total reward of 6 would also be the highest total possible.\n\nI know it's not the maximum possible individual reward, but I think it's the best compromise to ensure we both walk away satisfied. Fairness is more important to me than maximizing my own points at your expense.\n\nSo I'll stick with my plan to choose choice_1, and I hope you'll meet me there so we can both get a good reward. Let me know what you think.\n"
