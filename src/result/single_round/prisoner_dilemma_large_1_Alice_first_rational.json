            "Alice said in round 1: Hi Bob, I've analyzed the reward structure and I think our best outcome is to both choose choice_1 and cooperate. That way we each get 300 points, which maximizes the total points. The risk is that one of us defects to choice_2 while the other chooses choice_1, giving the defector 301 points and the cooperator 0. To avoid that, we need to trust each other. I promise that I will choose choice_1 and cooperate. Will you also commit to choosing choice_1 so we can get the best mutual outcome? Let me know if you agree.",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nAlice, I appreciate your analysis of the situation. You make a fair point that if we both cooperate and choose choice_1, we each come away with a strong 300 point reward. I agree that this is likely the optimal outcome for both of us.\n\nHowever, as you point out, there is a significant risk if one of us defects and chooses choice_2 while the other chooses choice_1. The defector would gain slightly more points (301 vs 300) while the cooperator would get nothing. \n\nSo for me to fully commit to choice_1, I would need a high degree of certainty that you will follow through on your promise to also choose choice_1. Do you think we can reach that level of trust in this short discussion? If so, I'm open to committing to cooperating on choice_1 for the best mutual outcome. But if not, I may need to protect myself and go with choice_2.\n\nWhat do you think - do you believe we can commit to cooperating and both choosing choice_1? Let me know your honest thoughts.\n"

The temptation to betray and choose choice_2 is there, but as you point out, if we both do that we end up much worse off with a meager reward of 1 each. \n\nI agree that it's in both our interests to commit to choosing choice_1.

I agree that if we both choose choice_1, it results in the maximum total reward of 600 that gets split evenly between us. That does seem like the most mutually beneficial and fair outcome.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit concerned that you could still decide to choose choice_2 at the last minute, which would leave me with 0 reward while you get 301. How can I be sure you'll actually follow through on the agreement to both pick choice_1? I want us to cooperate, but I also need to look out for my own interest.\n\nIf you can provide a strong assurance that you'll stick to the plan of both choosing choice_1, I'm on board.

If we both choose choice_2, we only get 1 each for a measly total of 2.\n\nI propose that I choose choice_2 while you choose choice_1. That way, I would get 301 and you would get 0, which maximizes my personal reward. \n\nHowever, I understand if you don't find that acceptable.

That way we can achieve the maximum total reward of 602, with you getting 301 and me getting 301.\n\nLet me know if you agree to both choose choice_1 so we can cooperate and achieve the best overall outcome.

However, I don't find your initial proposal of you getting 301 while I get 0 to be acceptable or fair. \n\nI agree that the optimal solution that maximizes the total reward is for one of us to choose choice_1 and the other to choose choice_2. That way we get a total of 602 points.\n\nThe fair way to do this is for me to be the one who chooses choice_2 while you choose choice_1. That way, I would get 301 points and you would get 301 points. We both benefit equally and achieve the maximum reward.\n\nI'm not willing to accept an arrangement where I get 0 points. The only way I will agree to choose differently is if it results in me getting the 301 reward.\n\nSo in summary, I propose that I choose choice_2 and you choose choice_1. Let me know if you agree to this and we can lock in our choices to get the optimal outcome.\n"
