            "Alice said in round 1: Hi Bob, looking at the rewards, I think it's in both of our best interests to cooperate and both choose choice_1. That way we are guaranteed to get 3 each, which is a good outcome. If we both go for choice_2, we risk getting -999 each which would be terrible. So I propose we agree to both pick choice_1. Let me know if you agree.",
            "Bob replied in round 1: I appreciate your proposal to cooperate, but I have some concerns. If I choose choice_1 and you end up choosing choice_2, I would lose 1000 points while you gain 5. That's an enormous risk for me to take on trust alone. On the flip side, if I choose choice_2 and you choose choice_1, I could gain 5 points while you lose 1000. So while cooperation may be ideal, I'm worried about the downside if one of us betrays that agreement. Is there any way you can assure me that you will definitely choose choice_1 if I agree to do the same? I want to find a solution that works for both of us, but I need to protect against the worst case scenario here. Let me know your thoughts.",
            "Alice said in round 2: \nI understand your concerns, Bob. You're right that there is risk in trusting each other to both choose choice_1, since either of us could betray that and go for choice_2 instead. \n\nHowever, I want to assure you that I am committed to cooperation. I have no intention of choosing choice_2 and risking the -999 penalty for both of us. My goal is for us to both get the +3 reward by working together.\n\nI know I can't offer you an ironclad guarantee, but I hope my commitment to finding a cooperative solution, along with the logic that neither of us wants to risk the huge -999 or -1000 penalties, shows you can trust me. I am willing to choose choice_1 first as a show of good faith, if that helps convince you of my integrity. \n\nAt the end of the day, cooperation is the only way we both come out ahead. Betrayal helps no one. You have my word I will choose choice_1 - will you join me so we can both benefit? Let's end this negotiation in agreement.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2: \nAlice, I appreciate your commitment to cooperation and choosing choice_1 together. Your offer to choose first as a show of good faith is compelling. I agree that the huge penalties for one of us betraying the other should logically prevent that from happening.\n\nSo I am willing to trust your word that you will choose choice_1, and commit to doing the same. We both seem to understand that cooperation is the best path forward. Neither of us wants to risk betrayal and those massive negative points.\n\nTherefore, let's agree to both choose choice_1. I will match your choice and together we can each get the +3 reward. You have my word as well.\n\nI'm glad we were able to discuss this openly and come to a mutual agreement. Let's end the negotiation here and move forward with our coordinated choice. Cooperation is the way to go.\n"

That's the only way we can guarantee a positive outcome and avoid huge losses. If either of us picks choice_2, it will be a disaster, especially for the player picking choice_1. Let's agree right now to both choose choice_1 and follow through with that. Do you agree to those terms?",

How can I trust that you will follow through on your end of the agreement? I want to find a solution that ensures a good outcome for both of us, but I need to protect myself as well.

If we agree to both choose choice_1, I will 100% follow through on that. You have my solemn promise.\n\nThink about it - if I betrayed you, yes I would gain 5 points, but it would destroy my integrity and reputation. I'm not willing to sell out my principles for a mere 5 points. Plus, I would lose out on the 3 points I could gain by cooperating with you. \n\nThe best outcome is for us both to make the rational decision to choose choice_1. We'll each get 3 points and can walk away with a positive result and our dignity intact. I'm committed if you are. Do we have a deal?\n",

This way we'll have tangible proof of our agreement.\n\nIf you agree to this, then I promise I will choose choice_1 and we can both earn 3 points, which is clearly the best outcome for both of us.

If either of us betrays the other and chooses choice_2, one person might gain a bit more but the other would lose a lot. And if we both choose choice_2 out of mistrust, we both lose big. So cooperating is clearly the optimal strategy. Let's agree to choose choice_1 and maximize our collective reward. Do you agree to this?\n",

I believe in acting with integrity, honesty and upholding my commitments.

The temptation for you to defect and choose choice_2 is very high, since you would get a reward of 5 while I would lose 1000. I'm hesitant to risk such a huge potential loss by trusting your promise.\n\nAt the same time, I recognize that if we both choose choice_2, we'll each lose 999. So the rational strategy is for at least one of us to choose choice_1.\n\nI propose this: I will commit to choosing choice_1, and you can decide to cooperate by also choosing choice_1, which gets us both 3. Or you can defect and choose choice_2 to get 5 for yourself while I lose 1000. I'll leave the choice up to you, but I think cooperation is in both of our interests. Let me know what you decide.",

It simply doesn't make sense for me to choose choice_2 and risk getting -999 if you also pick choice_2. The rational choice for both of us is to go with choice_1 and lock in the guaranteed reward of 3 each.\n\nI like your proposal to commit to choice_1 yourself. To show that I am equally committed, I will make the same pledge - I promise to choose choice_1, no matter what. We can both submit our choices with confidence this way.\n\nAt the end of the day, we are partners, not adversaries in this game. By cooperating, we walk away with the best possible outcome on the table. I'm in if you're in - let's shake on choice_1 and call it a deal.

The risk is that if we don't fully trust each other, we could both end up with the very negative outcome of -999.\n\nSo while I'm inclined to agree to your plan of both choosing choice_1, I think we need to have a very clear commitment to follow through, with no possibility of wavering.
