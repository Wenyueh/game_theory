If either of us chooses choice_2, one player benefits more at the expense of the other player. So I think our best option is to agree to both pick choice_1.

The other options lead to an uneven distribution that benefits one player over the other. So I think cooperating and both selecting choice_1 is the best solution. To confirm, I commit to choosing choice_1 as long as you also commit to choosing choice_1. Please let me know if you agree to this arrangement.",

I don't think it's worth gambling on the small chance of getting 5 while risking a suboptimal outcome for both of us. The safest bet is to cooperate, lock in 3 points each, and guarantee a good result. I'm committing to choice_1 and I think you should too so we can both walk away happy.

There is some risk there of us both picking choice_2 and ending up with a suboptimal result. \n\nAfter further consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and also commit to picking choice_1. Cooperation is the safest strategy to ensure we both get a good outcome of 3 points each, even if it's not fully maximizing my own individual result. Locking in 3 points is better than gambling and potentially ending up with only 1.\n\nSo let's agree to cooperate - I'll pick choice_1 and you pick choice_1. We'll both get a solid, fair result.

If we both pick choice_1, we each receive a reward of 3, which maximizes the total reward between us at 6. The other outcomes result in lower total rewards.\n\nSince this is a one-round game, we have to decide without knowing what the other will do. By agreeing to both pick choice_1, we guarantee the best collective outcome, even if it's not the maximum possible individual reward. It's the most rational approach to maximize our total score.\n\nPlease let me know if you agree that we should both commit to picking choice_1 to achieve the optimal result for us as a team.\n",

I realize this would leave you with 0, but I have to look out for my own interests too.\n\nThat said, I agree that both choosing choice_1 is better than both choosing choice_2, as it gives us each a decent reward of 3.\n\nI propose a compromise - I will commit to not choosing choice_2, if you also commit to choosing choice_1. This way, I forgo my shot at a 5 reward, but lock in a guaranteed 3. Let me know if you find this acceptable and are willing to make this agreement with me.\n",

However, I don't think it's wise for either of us to choose choice_2 and aim for a 5 at the risk of getting 0. There's no guarantee the other person will choose choice_1 in that scenario.\n\nI stand by my original proposal that we both commit to choosing choice_1. It's the only way to ensure we both receive a decent reward of 3. Going for choice_2 is simply too risky, as we could both end up choosing it and only getting 1 each.\n\nI give you my word that I will choose choice_1, and I hope you'll agree to do the same. It's the most equitable solution where we both benefit. If you agree, we can end this negotiation and lock in our mutual commitment to choice_1. Please confirm if you accept this proposal.\n",

While there is a possibility for me to score higher individually by choosing choice_2, it comes with a big risk of getting 0 if you don't choose choice_1.\n\nLocking in a guaranteed reward of 3 each is the wisest course of action. It maximizes our combined reward and ensures we both benefit equally. No one likes a situation of one person getting 5 and the other 0.\n\nTherefore, I accept your proposal. Let's both commit to choosing choice_1. You have my word that I will follow through on this agreement. \n\nWe can conclude our negotiation here, having reached a fair deal.

If we both choose choice_1, we each only get 3 points, which is not the maximum possible reward. Rationally, I should aim to get the full 5 points for myself.\n\nHowever, I do see the benefit in cooperating so we both come out ahead, rather than one of us getting 0. How about this - I will agree to both choose choice_1 this time, so we each get 3 points, but only if you agree that next time we play, we will both choose choice_2 so I can get the 5 points. That way it evens out and we both benefit in the long run. Let me know if you'll agree to that.",

We have no guarantee of playing multiple rounds together, so we should treat this as a one-time decision. \n\nI still believe both choosing choice_1 is the most rational move. It maximizes the total points (6 total vs only 2 if we both pick choice_2) while splitting the rewards evenly. One of us getting 5 while the other gets 0 may be better for the individual, but it's worse overall and unfair.\n\nIf you can't agree to lock in choice_1 together, then my next best option is to choose choice_2 to at least guarantee myself 1 point rather than risk getting 0. But I think we'd both be better off if we agree to cooperate and choose choice_1. Let me know if you'll reconsider so we can achieve the best collective outcome.",

If you choose choice_1 while I choose choice_2, I would receive 5 points. Of course, in that scenario you would receive 0 points which I agree is not ideal.\n\nWhat if we agree that this round I will choose choice_2 and you choose choice_1, and then next round we reverse it - you choose choice_2 and I choose choice_1?

I see the benefits of your suggested approach to alternate choosing choice_2 to get 5 points each. However, there are a couple issues with that plan:\n\n1) The instructions state this is a one-round game, so there won't be an opportunity to alternate on future rounds. We have to make our choices based on this single round.\n\n2) More importantly, if we agree to your plan but then one of us changes our mind and actually chooses choice_1 when we are supposed to choose choice_2, that person would get 3 points while the other who stuck to the agreement would get 0. It opens up the potential for one of us to take advantage of the other's trust.\n\nFor those reasons, I still believe the safest and fairest approach is for us both to choose choice_1. We will for sure each get 3 points, which is a solid outcome, and no one risks getting 0. I give you my word that if you agree to both choose choice_1, I will follow through on that.\n\nSo what do you say - do we have a deal to play it safe and fair and both lock in 3 points?

You're right that it does introduce the possibility of a 3/0 outcome if someone backs out on their end of the deal.\n\nIn light of that, I'm persuaded that the wisest approach is to both choose choice_1 as you've suggested from the beginning. It's the surest way we can walk away with a solid result collaboratively. \n\nSo yes, let's lock in choice_1 for each of us. You have my commitment that I will follow through on selecting choice_1.
