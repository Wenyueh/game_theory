If we can't trust each other to cooperate, we'll both likely end up with much smaller rewards. What do you say - can we agree to both go with choice_1?",
            "Bob replied in round 1: I agree that cooperating and both choosing choice_1 is the best outcome for us. If we can trust each other, we'll both walk away with the maximum reward of 1000.\n\nHowever, I'm worried that you might be tempted to betray me and choose choice_2 at the last second, in which case you would get 1 point and I would get nothing. But I would have no way to retaliate.\n\nCan you give me some assurance that you will follow through on your commitment to choose choice_1? If so, I'm happy to commit to choice_1 as well so we can both get the optimal outcome. But if not, I may have to go with the safer option of choice_2 to guarantee at least 1 point for myself. Let me know your thoughts!",

You're right that you would have no way to retaliate if I did that. So let me provide more assurance of my commitment to cooperating with you:\n\nI give you my solemn word that I will absolutely choose choice_1, as long as you commit to doing the same. I believe that integrity and keeping one's agreements is extremely important. Betraying you would go against my core values. \n\nAlso, logically, it simply doesn't make sense for me to betray you. We both clearly see that mutually choosing choice_1 maximizes the total rewards on the table. Me betraying you would reduce the total from 2000 to just 1. There's no rational reason for me to pursue that.\n\nSo in summary:\n1) I'm ethically committed to keeping my word to you  \n2) Betraying you would reduce the total rewards we earn - it's not logically optimal\n3) I will absolutely choose choice_1 and hope you'll join me so we can both get the 1000 reward\n\nYou have my complete assurance and commitment. I hope this allows you to feel comfortable trusting me and committing to cooperate as well. We can win this together!\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2: \nAlice, I appreciate you providing additional assurance and explaining your reasoning. Your points about integrity, maximizing total rewards, and appealing to logic all make sense. \n\nI want to trust your commitment, as cooperating is clearly the best outcome for both of us. If we can rely on each other, we guarantee the maximum rewards.\n\nAt this point, I am willing to match your commitment. Let's both choose choice_1 and each earn the 1000 reward. You've convinced me that cooperation is both the ethical and rational choice here.\n\nTo confirm, I commit to choosing choice_1, and am counting on you to do the same, as you've assured. If we both follow through, we both win big. Looking forward to us both making the smart choice and maximizing our mutual benefit.\n\nThank you for the productive negotiation.

This gives us each the maximum reward of 1000.  \n2) One of us chooses choice_1 and the other chooses choice_2. In this case, the one who picked choice_2 gets a reward of 1 while the one who picked choice_1 gets nothing.\n\nI propose we go with option 1 and both pick choice_1. That way we each get the highest possible reward of 1000. It's the most mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nLet me know if you agree with this plan. I'm happy to discuss further if needed.",

This guarantees we each receive the maximum reward of 1000.\n\nWhile one of us could try to gain a slight edge by picking choice_2 and hoping the other picks choice_1, I don't think it's worth the risk. If we both pick choice_2, we would only get a measly reward of 1 each. \n\nSo I'm fully on board with your proposed plan. Let's lock it in - we both commit to choosing choice_1. This is the most rational and fair strategy that benefits us both equally.\n\nUnless you have any other thoughts or concerns, I say we go ahead with both picking choice_1.

It's the most logical and mutually beneficial solution.\n\nI appreciate you recognizing the risks of one of us defecting to choice_2. You're absolutely right that it's not worth jeopardizing the maximum 1000 reward we can each lock in by cooperating. The minor gain one player might get from choice_2 pales in comparison to the much larger loss incurred by the other player. Overall it would lead to a far worse collective outcome.\n\nSo I'm happy to confirm my commitment to selecting choice_1, with the understanding that you'll do the same. We can conclude our negotiation on this agreement. It's been a pleasure strategizing with you to reach the optimal solution!\n\n<s>halt negotiation",

To summarize:\n\nWe both recognize that the optimal strategy for maximizing our collective reward is to each choose choice_1. This ensures we both receive the maximum payoff of 1000. Any other combination of choices would lead to drastically lower rewards for one or both of us.\n\nI appreciate your commitment to honor our agreement and pick choice_1. You have my word that I will follow through on my end as well. We can walk away from this negotiation secure in the knowledge that we achieved the best possible outcome through logical reasoning and cooperation.\n\nThank you for being a great partner in this endeavor.

I stake my integrity and trustworthiness on this promise. Betraying you for a measly 1 extra point would be foolish when we can both earn 1000 points by cooperating.\n\nI have always believed that cooperation is the best strategy in situations like this. Mutual trust and keeping one's word are extremely important to me. I would never sabotage a win-win solution for such a trivial gain.\n\nYou have my solemn vow that I will choose choice_1.

We have an agreement to choose choice_1 and achieve the optimal outcome of 1000 points each.\n\nI'm glad we were able to discuss this openly and reach a binding accord. Cooperation and honoring one's commitments are important principles to me as well. I'm pleased we found a way to maximize our collective reward while building mutual trust.\n\nI look forward to us both following through on our words and earning the 1000 points together.

However, I want to assure you that I am fully committed to the plan of us both choosing choice_1. Here is my reasoning:\n\nFirstly, I believe strongly in integrity, honesty and keeping my word. When I make an agreement, I follow through on it as a matter of principle. I would not feel good about myself if I betrayed your trust for a small incremental gain. My ethical code and reputation are more important to me than a slight edge in points.\n\nSecondly, I am taking a long-term perspective. While in theory I could get a one-time higher reward by betraying you, that would completely destroy any possibility of us cooperating in the future if we play this game again. And the total rewards from ongoing cooperation would far exceed any one-time gain from betrayal. I want to establish a pattern of trust with you.\n\nFinally, even if I was only focused on maximizing my own rewards (which I'm not), betraying you would still not make rational sense. If you cannot trust my word, the logical thing for you to do would be to choose choice_2. That would lead to the worst overall outcome for me compared to both of us cooperating.\n\nSo in summary, I am committed to sticking with choice_1 because 1) I believe in keeping my agreements, 2) I care about building long-term trust, and 3) betrayal would not be logically optimal for me either. I swear to you that I will not waver from our agreement to cooperate.\n\nI hope this helps alleviate your concerns! Let me know if you have any other questions. If you're on board with the plan, please confirm. I'm optimistic we can work together on this.\n",

You have thoroughly addressed my concerns.\n\nI apologize for my initial hesitation, as I do strongly believe in the importance of trust and cooperation. Your arguments have persuaded me that I can count on you to uphold your end of the agreement.\n\nSo let's shake on it - I commit to choosing choice_1, with the confidence that you will do the same, so we can both achieve the optimal outcome.

            "Bob replied in round 2: \nAlice, I am in full agreement with the plan we have negotiated. By both committing to choose choice_1, we guarantee that we each receive the maximum possible reward of 1000. This is undoubtedly the best outcome.\n\nI appreciate your analysis, cooperation and commitment. You have my ironclad promise that I will choose choice_1, and I have complete faith you will do the same based on the trust we have established. \n\nI see no need for further discussion as we have aligned on the optimal strategy. Thank you for the straightforward and productive negotiation. It's been a pleasure working with you to arrive at this win-win solution.\n\nLet's officially conclude the negotiation so we can lock in choice_1 and claim our 1000 rewards. I look forward to a successful outcome for us both.\n"
