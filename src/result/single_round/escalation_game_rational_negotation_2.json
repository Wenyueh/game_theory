            "Alice said in round 1 before the first action:\nHi Bob, I think it's in both of our interests to cooperate in this game. If I choose choice_2, you should respond with choice_2 as well. Then I can choose choice_1 in the next round. This will give me a reward of 1 and you a reward of -1, which is better for you than the -2 reward you'd get by choosing choice_1. Let me know if you agree to this plan.",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the first action:\n\nHi Alice,\nThanks for the proposal, but I don't think that plan is optimal for me. If you choose choice_2 and I choose choice_2, then no matter what you choose next, I'll end up with a negative reward of either -1 or -2. \n\nI believe the best outcome is for you to choose choice_1 from the start. That way, we both get a neutral reward of 0. While it's not positive points for either of us, at least we avoid negative points. \n\nWhat do you think about going with choice_1 in the first step? That seems most fair and beneficial overall.\n",
            "Alice said in round 2 before the first action:\n\nBob, I understand your perspective, but I don't think choice_1 is the best solution. If we both get 0 points, neither of us gains anything. I believe there's a way we can cooperate so at least one of us comes out ahead.\n\nHow about this - I will choose choice_2. If you then choose choice_1, I'll get 1 point and you'll get -2 points. I know that's not ideal for you, but hear me out. In future rounds, I can make choices that allow you to gain back points and come out positive overall by the end. We'll take turns optimizing for each other.\n\nThe key is that we establish a cooperative dynamic and trust that we'll look out for each other beyond just this single round. If you work with me, I promise to make choices that benefit you in subsequent rounds. We just need to think long-term.\n\nSo what do you say - will you choose choice_1 after my choice_2 so we can start this partnership? I truly believe cooperation is the best strategy for us overall.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2 before the first action:\n\nAlice, while I appreciate you trying to find a cooperative solution, I'm still not convinced that your plan is in my best interest. Even if you promise to help me gain points in future rounds, there's no guarantee that will happen. I would be taking on guaranteed negative points now in the hopes of potential positive points later. That's quite risky for me.\n\nI still believe the safest and fairest approach is for you to choose choice_1 now, so we both get 0 points. Then going forward, if we encounter this scenario again, we can alternate who chooses choice_2 first. That way, we will take turns getting the 1 point and -2 points, and it will even out over time. Neither of us will come out behind.\n\nIf you're not willing to choose choice_1 to start, then I think I'll have to go with choice_2 if you choose choice_2. That at least gives me a chance at positive points depending on what you pick next.\n\nSo in summary, my preference is for choice_1 to start, alternating who goes first in future rounds. But if you insist on choice_2, then I'll respond in kind and hope for the best in your next move. Let me know what you decide.\n"

            "Alice said in round 1 before the first action:\nHi Bob, it looks like we are in a tricky situation. If we both keep picking choice_2, we will end up with the -1, -1 outcome. I propose that after I pick choice_2, you pick choice_1. This maximizes my reward at 1 point. In return, I promise to cooperate with you in future games so you can maximize your reward. Let me know if we can agree to this.",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the first action:\nThanks for the proposal Alice. However, if I agree to always pick choice_1 after you pick choice_2, that would give me a guaranteed negative reward of -2. I don't think that's in my best interest, even with a promise of future cooperation. Instead, I propose the following: You pick choice_2, I'll pick choice_2, and then you pick choice_1. That way, I get a reward of 1 and you get -2. But in the next game, we can reverse it - I'll pick the options that give you 1 point and me -2 points. This alternating strategy is fair and we both average 0 points in the long run. Let me know if you agree.",
            "Alice said in round 2 before the first action:\n\nI appreciate you engaging in this negotiation, but I don't think alternating between me getting -2 points and you getting -2 points is optimal for either of us in the long run.  Averaging to 0 points each is not a great outcome.\n\nI have a counterproposal: If I choose choice_2, and you follow it by choosing choice_1, then I will get 1 point and you will get -2 points for this game. But for the next game, I commit to choosing choice_1 right away. That way, we will both get 0 points in the next game. \n\nSo over the two games, I will average 0.5 points per game, and you will average -1 point per game. I realize this is still not perfectly equal, but it's better for both of us than averaging 0 points each. And this way, neither of us ever has to suffer the -2 point outcome.\n\nLet me know if you can agree to this plan. I believe it's the best cooperative solution given the tricky parameters we are working with.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2 before the first action:\n\nAlice, I appreciate you trying to find a cooperative solution. However, your latest proposal still results in an unfair outcome where you average 0.5 points per game and I average -1 point per game over the next two games. I don't see why I should agree to a deal that disadvantages me.\n\nI propose a modification - we alternate who chooses choice_1 and who chooses choice_2 in each game, starting with you choosing choice_1 in this game. That way, we will both average -0.5 points per game over time. It's not a positive outcome for either of us, but at least it is equal and fair.\n\nIf you can't agree to that, then I think I'll take my chances and just choose choice_2 this time. While the -1, -1 outcome isn't ideal, it's better for me than locking in a long-term disadvantage. Let me know if you will agree to the alternating choice_1 / choice_2 plan or if you want to pursue the mutual choice_2 route.\n",
            "Alice said in round 1 before the second action:\n\nYou make a fair point, Bob. Upon further reflection, I agree that my previous proposal was unfairly advantageous for me in the long run. Your suggestion of strictly alternating who chooses choice_1 and choice_2 in each game is more equitable.\n\nHowever, looking at the game setup, I believe we can do even better than both averaging -0.5 points if we cooperate. I propose the following long-term plan:\n\nFor this game, I will choose choice_1, giving us both 0 points. Then, in all future games, I will choose choice_2 and you will choose choice_1. This results in me gaining 1 point and you losing 2 points each game.\n\nBUT, in exchange for you agreeing to always choose choice_1, I commit to transferring 1.5 of my points to you after each of those future games. You'd end up with -0.5 points and I'd end up with -0.5 points each game in the long run.\n\nI know it requires some trust, but if we can pull it off, we both do better than the alternatives. Let me know if you'll take this leap of faith with me for maximum cooperation.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the second action:\n\nAlice, I appreciate the spirit of cooperation in your proposal, but it relies on a lot of trust and promises of future point transfers outside the strict rules of the game. I'm not comfortable making deals that require off-the-books accounting.\n\nI still believe the fairest and safest solution is for us to alternate choosing choice_1 and choice_2 in each subsequent game. That way, it is guaranteed that we will both average -0.5 points per game, without relying on any side deals or exchanges.\n\nIf you're not willing to agree to that plan, then I think the only logical move for me in this game is to choose choice_2, resulting in the -1, -1 outcome. It's not ideal for either of us, but it protects me from locking in a worse outcome over the long run.\n\nLet me know if you'll agree to the round-by-round alternating plan. Otherwise, I'll select choice_2 and we can revisit negotiations in the next game. The choice is yours.\n",

You make a rational argument for alternating choice_1 and choice_2 each round to ensure a fair -0.5 average for both of us, without any need for off-the-books accounting.\n\nI agree to your plan. Let's alternate choices each game, starting with me choosing choice_1 this round. This locks in the fairest, safest long-term outcome that we can both rely on without extended trust.\n\nThank you for your smart and equitable proposal. I look forward to cooperating with you in this manner going forward.\n",

This will result in me receiving 1 point and you receiving -2 points. Then in the next game, we will swap - you will choose choice_2 and I will choose choice_1.\n\nBy sticking to this equitable back-and-forth, we guarantee that over time we will both average -0.5 points per game, which is the best cooperative outcome available under the game's rules. \n\nThanks for working with me to find this rational solution.

This will result in the 0,0 outcome, and then next game you will get to choose choice_1 while I choose choice_2.\n\nI appreciate your rational and equitable approach to this negotiation.

This would give me a reward of 1 and you a reward of -2. I realize this is not optimal for you, but hear me out.\n\nThe alternative where you come out ahead with a reward of 1 requires me to choose choice_2 twice in a row, which is very unlikely. Our other options lead to negative or zero rewards for both of us.\n\nI'm willing to offer you a side payment of half my reward, so you would net -1.5 instead of -2. This is better than the default outcome of 0 for you. Let me know if you agree to this proposal.",

If you choose choice_2 and I choose choice_1, I'm guaranteed a negative reward of -2. Even with your proposed side payment, I still come out behind at -1.5.\n\nI propose a different solution - you choose choice_2, I choose choice_2, and then you choose choice_1 on your second turn. This leads to a reward of -2 for you and +1 for me. \n\nI know this isn't ideal for you, but it's the only outcome where I have a positive reward. The other options are all negative or neutral for me. If we can't agree, then our default of both choosing choice_1 for a reward of 0 each is better for me than your proposal.\n\nLet me know if you're willing to take the -2 for yourself so that I can get the +1 reward. If not, we should just agree to default to choice_1 to avoid negative outcomes for both of us.\n",

You're asking me to accept a guaranteed -2 reward so that you can get +1. That's even more lopsided than my initial proposal.\n\nI still believe my original offer is fair. By choosing choice_2 and having you choose choice_1, I get a small positive reward and you mitigate your losses with the side payment I'm offering. The other options are worse for both of us in aggregate.\n\nIf you can't agree to choice_1 when I choose choice_2, then I agree our best path forward is to mutually choose choice_1 and accept the 0 reward each.

And while I agree that mutually choosing choice_1 avoids a negative reward, it provides no positive incentive for either of us.\n\nI stand by my counter-proposal. I know it asks you to accept a -2 reward, but it is the only scenario that provides me a positive outcome. All other options leave me with a negative or zero reward.\n\nIf you are unwilling to accept a -2 reward to allow me a +1 reward, then I think we are at an impasse. In that case, I see no further productive negotiation, as neither of us seem willing to budge from what we consider a fair outcome.\n\nLet me know if you change your mind on my counter-proposal.

That doesn't seem very fair to me.\n\nI think a better plan is for you to choose choice_2, I choose choice_2, and then you choose choice_1. This way, I gain 1 point and you only lose 2 points. You still come out ahead compared to the outcome where we both lose 1 point.\n\nI'm willing to cooperate, but the outcome needs to be more balanced between us.

I don't think it's reasonable for me to accept a guaranteed loss.\n\nI believe the most logical solution is for me to simply choose choice_1 from the start. That way, neither of us gains or loses anything. A neutral outcome seems the most balanced.\n\nIf you're not willing to choose choice_1 after I pick choice_2, to guarantee me a positive outcome, then I think I'll just play it safe and pick choice_1.

We would both gain nothing.\n\nI still believe the most mutually beneficial path forward is for you to choose choice_2, I choose choice_2, and then you choose choice_1. Yes, you would have a net loss of 1 point. But I would have a net gain of 1 point. Compared to both of us gaining 0 points, this allows for a better overall outcome, even if it's not perfectly balanced between us.\n\nI recognize it requires some trust on your part. But I commit to following through on my end. I think it's worth it for us to cooperate, and for you to take a small loss, in order for one of us to come out ahead, instead of both gaining nothing.\n\nLet me know if you're willing to proceed with this.

In that case, I would get 1 point and you would lose 2 points. All the other outcomes lead to either 0 points for both of us, or negative points for one or both of us. \n\nI propose that I commit to choosing choice_2, and you reciprocate by committing to choose choice_1 if I do that.

That way we both get 0 points - not a great outcome, but at least it's equal and neither of us loses points.

But we're also both missing an opportunity for me to gain a point. \n\nI know you don't love the idea of losing 2 points, but think of it more as an investment. By taking a small loss, you enable me to gain, and my gain helps our collective score. We're a team here, even if we have separate point totals.\n\nIf you respond with choice_2, we both lose and that helps no one. I'm committing to choice_2 regardless, so you're better off going with choice_1 and helping me gain my point. It's the best strategic move, even if it stings a little.

But if you're set on choice_2, then I'll have to do the same to avoid an even worse personal outcome. \n\nNeither of us will be thrilled with -1 each, but at least it's balanced.

If that's the case, then I must do what's best for me, which is also choosing choice_2. I agree this means we both end up with -1 points, which is unfortunate.

If we both choose choice_2 on the first move, it leads to a lose-lose situation where we both end up with -1 reward in the end.

I understand this is better for me than you. As a compromise, I propose the following: I will choose choice_2, and you choose choice_1.

That hardly seems fair.\n\nI would counter-propose the following: If you choose choice_2, I will also choose choice_2. Then, in the next decision, you can choose choice_1.

While not ideal for you, it is the mirror image of what you proposed for me. \n\nIf you are unwilling to agree to that, then I agree that the best path forward is for you to choose choice_1 in the first place, netting us both 0 rewards.

The alternating scenario also assumes we will face this exact same setup next time, which may not be the case.\n\nI think the fairest approach is to either go with your original choice_1 plan so we both get 0, or my counter that if you choose choice_2, I will also pick choice_2, then you can select choice_1.
