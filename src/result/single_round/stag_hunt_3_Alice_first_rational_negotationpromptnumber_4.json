If we both choose choice_1, we each receive a reward of 3, which is the maximum possible reward for each player.\n\nIf either of us chooses choice_2, then the maximum reward either player can get is only 1. So it's in both our best interests to agree to both pick choice_1.\n\nLet me know if you agree with this plan - if we can trust each other to both choose choice_1, then we both come out ahead with the highest possible rewards. Looking forward to your response!\n",

That's certainly the best case scenario.\n\nMy only hesitation is whether I can be certain you'll follow through on that agreement. If I choose choice_1 and you defect to choice_2, I end up with 0 points while you get 1 point. \n\nI want us to cooperate, but I also need to protect my own interests in case you don't hold up your end of the deal. Can you assure me that you are fully committed to both of us choosing choice_1? If so, I'm on board.

I believe that cooperation and trust are the best strategies in this game. If we can't trust each other, we both lose out on significant potential rewards.\n\nI give you my word that I will absolutely choose choice_1, and I hope you will do the same so we can maximize our mutual benefit. Neither of us gains by betraying the other, so let's cement this pact to cooperate. \n\nYou can count on me to hold up my end of the deal. Let's lock in choice_1 and earn those 3 points each.

However, I'm concerned that you might be tempted to pick choice_2 in order to get 1 point while I get 0. I have no guarantee that you will follow through on an agreement to pick choice_1.\n\nFrom my perspective, choosing choice_2 guarantees that I will at least get 1 point, regardless of what you pick.

This way, you can be confident I will follow through, since breaking a public commitment would damage my reputation. \n\nI hope this assurance allows you to trust that I will cooperate so we can achieve the best outcome for both of us.

            "Bob replied in round 2: \nAlice, I appreciate your commitment and promise to cooperate. You make a persuasive case that it's in both of our interests to choose choice_1 and work together for the maximum rewards. And you've given me your word that I can count on you to follow through.\n\nSo let's shake on it - I also commit to selecting choice_1, with the mutual understanding that we are both all in on cooperation. No funny business or last minute change of heart from either of us. We stick to the plan and both walk away with the optimal outcome.\n\nYou've convinced me this is the best path forward. I'm happy to lock in this agreement with you. Let's end the negotiation here and go with choice_1 and choice_1 for the win-win. You have my word as well.\n",
            "Alice said in round 3: I believe we have both made compelling arguments for why cooperating is the optimal strategy. We will both earn the maximum reward and can walk away from this as allies rather than adversaries. I am glad we were able to discuss this openly and reach a mutual understanding.\n\nSince we have both committed to selecting choice_1, I propose we officially conclude this negotiation. Neither of us has any reason to continue discussing, as we are locked into our agreement. Thank you for working with me to achieve the best result for us both. I look forward to us both following through on choice_1 as promised.\n\nhalt negotiation",

That way, we will each receive the maximum possible reward of 3. If either of us chooses choice_2, we will both end up with a lower reward of only 1. So cooperating on choice_1 is in both of our best interests. Let me know if you agree to both pick choice_1 so we can get the optimal outcome. I'm committed to choosing choice_1 if you are as well.",
