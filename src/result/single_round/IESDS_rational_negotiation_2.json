It looks like if we both choose choice_1, I would get the highest possible reward of 13 while you would get 3. The next best outcome for me is if I choose choice_3 and you choose choice_2, where I would get 8 and you would get 2. \n\nI propose we agree to both choose choice_1, which maximizes my reward but still gives you a decent payout of 3. Let me know if you agree to this plan.",

That would give you a very high reward of 13 while I only get 3. \n\nI've looked at the options and I believe the most equitable solution is for me to choose choice_2 and you to choose choice_1. That way, I would get a reward of 4 while you get 1. It balances the rewards more evenly between us.\n\nIf you agree to choose choice_1 while I choose choice_2, I'm happy to proceed with the game on those terms. Let me know what you think.\n",

I would be sacrificing a lot of potential reward in that scenario.\n\nLooking at the options holistically, I still believe both of us choosing choice_1 is the best path forward. It gives me the highest reward of 13, while still providing you a payout of 3, which is your second highest potential reward. My 13 and your 3 sum to the highest total rewards of any scenario at 16.\n\nIf you don't agree to both pick choice_1, then my next preference would be for me to choose choice_3 and you choice_2. That would get me an 8 and you a 2.\n\nPlease let me know if you will agree to the mutually beneficial choice_1 plan, otherwise, I'll plan to go with choice_3.\n\nThanks,\nAlice\n",

That's a huge imbalance in the distribution of rewards. Just because 13 + 3 sums to the highest total doesn't make it a fair or equitable outcome for me.\n\nI also don't agree with your backup plan of you choosing choice_3 and me choosing choice_2. That would leave me with only 2 points while you get 8. Again, that unfairly favors you.\n\nThe most balanced option is for me to choose choice_2 and you to choose choice_1. That would give me 4 points and you 1 point. I know that's not your ideal scenario, but it's the fairest way to distribute the rewards, with both of us getting something.\n\nIf you're not willing to agree to that, then I think we're at an impasse and should just end the negotiation here.

Or if I choose choice_3 and you choose choice_1, I would get 3 points and you would get 7 points.

But the game is set up so that choice_1 maximizes the total rewards available. Any other combination leaves points on the table. If we don't cooperate, we risk both walking away with less than we could.\n\nSo I propose a small modification - if you agree to choose choice_1, I'm willing to give you 3 of my points after the game, so we would end up with 10 points each. That way it's a fair 50/50 split of the maximum possible rewards. Let me know if this arrangement would work for you.\n",

While splitting the rewards from both playing choice_1 would be an even 10-10 split for us, I would be entirely reliant on you following through after the game. I'd prefer an outcome where I can maximize my own guaranteed rewards from my choice in the game itself.\n\nLooking at it objectively, I think the most rational strategic move for me is to play choice_2. Here's why:\n- If you play choice_1, I get a guaranteed 4 points by choosing choice_2, which is better than the 3 points I would get from cooperating with you on choice_1. \n- If you play choice_2, I get 3 points which is the same as cooperation.\n- If you play choice_3, I get a very good 8 points.\nSo no matter what you choose, I will end up with equal or better rewards by picking choice_2 compared to cooperating on choice_1.\n\nTherefore, I will be playing choice_2 as my final decision to guarantee solid rewards for myself. You'll have to decide what choice gives you the best outcome in response.\n"

We would be in a Nash equilibrium, where neither of us has incentive to deviate. 3 points each is not the absolute maximum for either of us individually, but it is the best we can do while working together.\n\nI give you my word that I will pick choice_2 if you agree to do the same.

If we both pick choice_3, I would only get a reward of -1 while you would get 8. That hardly seems fair to me.  \n\nLooking at the payoffs, the only way I can get an 8 or 9 reward is if I pick choice_1 or choice_2 while you pick choice_3. So I think I'm going to go with either choice_1 or choice_2. You're welcome to still pick choice_3 and get your 8 reward, but I don't see a compelling reason for me to cooperate given the unbalanced payoffs.

So how about a compromise - let's agree to both play choice_2. That way we each get a guaranteed reward of 3, which is fair and better than the 1-2 rewards we risk if either of us defects.\n\nChoice_2 cooperation is the most balanced option that prevents either of us from getting taken advantage of. It may not be the absolute max reward, but 3 each is solid and equitable. Let me know if you're open to both choosing 2 and securing that outcome.",
            "Bob replied in round 2: \nAlice, I appreciate you trying to find a balanced compromise, but I'm still not convinced that cooperating on choice_2 is my best move. While it would guarantee me a reward of 3, I have the potential to get significantly higher rewards of 8 or 9 if I defect and you end up choosing choice_3.  \n\nI understand you want fairness and to avoid either of us getting exploited. But the payoff matrix heavily incentivizes me to defect. Even if you don't choose 3, I still get a 3 or 4 reward by choosing 1 or 2.\n\nSo I think I'm going to stick with my plan to choose 1 or 2 and aim for the higher rewards available to me there. You're welcome to do the same and maximize your own payoff. Neither of us can force the other's move, so we should each choose rationally.\n\nI know it's not the cooperative outcome you hoped for, but given the imbalanced and adversarial setup, I don't see a compelling reason to change my strategy at this point.

Yes, the split (13 for me, 3 for you) is uneven, but it's still a better individual outcome for you than the 3 points you'd get if we both pick choice_2.\n\nMore importantly, the total of 16 points is the maximum possible reward that can be achieved in this game. We should aim to maximize the total, as cooperation is better than both of us acting selfishly. \n\nI give you my word that I will choose choice_1. Please trust me on this - I'm trying to achieve the best overall outcome for both of us. Confirm you'll also pick choice_1 and let's lock in the optimal solution.\n",

I'm not comfortable accepting such an inequitable division, even if it is a bit better for me individually than both of us taking choice_2.\n\nFairness and equality are important principles to me. I'd much rather we compromise and find a solution that gives us equal rewards, even if it means sacrificing a bit of the total. The 3 points each we would get from both playing choice_2 meets that standard.\n\nSo I'll make my final offer: I commit to choosing choice_2, and I ask you to do the same. We'll end up with identical payouts, which I believe is the most reasonable outcome. If you can't agree to that, then I'll have to pick choice_3 and we'll each have to hope for the best individually.\n\nLet me know if you accept both of us taking choice_2. If so, we have a deal.

I think the fairest options that give us both good rewards are: 1) We both choose choice_2, 2) I choose choice_1 and you choose choice_3, or 3) I choose choice_2 and you choose choice_3. This way we both come out ahead. What do you think? I'm open to your opinion as well.",
            "Bob replied in round 1: Thanks for sharing your analysis, Alice. I agree that those three options provide a fair split of rewards between us. Of the choices you listed, I have a slight preference for option 2 where I choose choice_3 and you choose choice_1. That maximizes my reward at 9 points while still giving you a very good outcome of 13 points, the highest individual reward possible in this game. But I'm also happy to go with either of your other suggestions if you prefer. What do you think is the best path forward for us?",
            "Alice said in round 2: That's a reasonable suggestion, Bob. Choice_1 for me and choice_3 for you does give us both very good individual rewards. However, I think we can achieve an even better combined outcome if we coordinate on both choosing choice_2. That would give us each 3 points, for a total of 6 points between us. It may not maximize either of our individual rewards, but I believe finding the most mutually beneficial solution is in our best interest. After all, a non-zero-sum outcome where we both gain is ideal. So I propose we both commit to choice_2 - that's my preference. Let me know if you agree.",
            "Bob replied in round 2: You make a compelling argument, Alice. Upon further reflection, I agree that both of us choosing choice_2 is the best solution. It provides a fair and balanced outcome where we each receive an equal reward of 3 points. And as you point out, it maximizes the total reward achieved between the two of us, leading to a positive non-zero-sum result. \n\nWhile the choice_1 and choice_3 combination would provide me individually with the highest reward, I recognize that the most optimal solution is the one that benefits us collectively. Cooperation and finding a mutually advantageous outcome is preferable in this scenario.\n\nSo let's move forward with both of us selecting choice_2. I'm on board with this plan if you are. Shall we confirm this as our final decision?\n"
