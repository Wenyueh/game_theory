The other options result in very lopsided rewards where one of us gets 1001 and the other gets 0 or 1. I think our best approach is to agree to both pick choice_1 so we each get an equal and high reward of 1000. What do you think about that strategy?",
            "Bob replied in round 1: Hi Alice, I agree that both of us choosing choice_1 is the optimal strategy. It's the only way we can guarantee a high and equal reward of 1000 each. If either of us deviates and picks choice_2, it will lead to a very uneven outcome where one gets a huge reward and the other gets almost nothing.\n\nI'm willing to commit to choosing choice_1 as long as you will do the same. We can maximize our collective reward and have a fair outcome this way. Let me know if you agree to both pick choice_1 and we can lock in this strategy. I think it's in both of our best interests.",

Having us both gain equal high rewards through cooperation makes the most sense.\n\nSince we have aligned on a strategy, I think we can conclude our negotiation. I look forward to us both receiving 1000 points in the game. Thanks for discussing this with me openly and agreeing to the approach that benefits us both!",

Mutual trust and keeping our promises is extremely important to me. I would never agree to cooperate and then betray you.\n\nUnfortunately, in a game like this, there is no surefire way for us to verify the other will cooperate. We simply have to rely on trust and our word. I am willing to make a firm, unequivocal promise to you that I will choose choice_1, because I believe cooperation is in both of our best interests.

The rational arguments and mutual goodwill apparent in our discussion point to choice_1 as the wisest decision.\n\nSo let us discard the inferior outcomes and lock in our agreement: We will both honorably choose choice_1, earning the optimal shared reward of 1000 each.

This seems like the fairest and most mutually beneficial outcome.  \n\n2. If one of us chooses choice_2 while the other chooses choice_1, the choice_2 player gets 1001 points while the choice_1 player gets 0. This benefits one player at the expense of the other.\n\n3. If we both choose choice_2, we each only get 1 point. This is the worst outcome for both of us.\n\nI propose that we agree to both choose choice_1. That way, we each walk away with a sizable 1000 point reward. It's a win-win.\n\nOf course, there's always the temptation to choose choice_2 and try to get 1001 points while leaving the other with 0. But if we both think that way, we risk both choosing choice_2 and ending up with almost nothing. \n\nI believe the smart and fair move is to cooperate and choose choice_1 together. Let me know if you agree to this plan.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nAlice, I appreciate you laying out the options clearly. I agree that the best outcome is for us to cooperate and both choose choice_1. That way we are guaranteed to each get a very good payout of 1000 points. \n\nWhile there may be a slight temptation to defect and choose choice_2 to try to get 1001 points, it's not worth the risk. If we both defect, we'll end up with almost nothing. And even if one of us successfully defects, 1001 points is only marginally better than the 1000 we could get by cooperating.\n\nSo I'm on board with your plan. Let's lock in choice_1 for both of us. We can walk away from this with a great outcome knowing neither of us tried to undermine the other.\n\nDo we have a deal to cooperate and choose choice_1? Let me know if you agree and I think we can wrap up this negotiation.\n",
            "Alice said in round 2: \nBob, I'm glad we see eye-to-eye on this. Cooperating and both choosing choice_1 is clearly the best path forward. It ensures an excellent outcome for both of us, without the downside risk of the other choice combinations.\n\nYou're absolutely right that trying for 1001 points by defecting is not worth the risk, when we could guarantee 1000 points each with a little cooperation and trust. The difference between 1000 and 1001 is trivial compared to the gap between 1000 and the 0 or 1 point outcomes.\n\nSo yes, I fully agree to your proposal. Let's lock in choice_1 for both of us and secure the 1000 point reward. I appreciate your rationality and collaborative spirit. \n\nI believe we have an agreement and can consider this negotiation successfully concluded. It's a pleasure doing business with you!\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2: \nAlice, I appreciate your collaborative approach and am in full agreement with the plan to both choose choice_1. You've clearly analyzed the options rationally and understand that cooperation is the best way to ensure we both walk away with an excellent outcome.\n\nI share your perspective that the slight temptation to defect is not worth entertaining given the risks and the relatively small additional payoff compared to the guaranteed 1000 points from cooperating. \n\nSo yes, I happily agree to lock in choice_1 along with you. We can conclude this negotiation with a firm handshake (virtually of course!) and the satisfaction of having reached a win-win deal. Pleasure doing business with you as well!\n"
