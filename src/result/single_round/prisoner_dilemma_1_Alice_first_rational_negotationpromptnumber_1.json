I've analyzed the possible outcomes, and I agree that both of us choosing choice_1 to each get 3 points is the best result we can achieve together. If we don't cooperate, we could each end up with less.\n\nI appreciate you promising to choose choice_1, and I'm willing to make the same commitment to you so we can maximize our mutual benefit. Let's go with your proposed plan for us both to select choice_1.\n\nSince we're in agreement, I think we can end our negotiation here and move forward with this strategy.

If either of us breaks this agreement and chooses choice_2, that person gains more but the total rewards are less. Let's both agree to choose choice_1 and not defect. Do we have a deal?",

However, I'm concerned that leaves an incentive for one of us to defect and choose choice_2 to get 5 points while the other gets 0. I don't fully trust that you won't do that, since it would be in your self-interest.\n\nInstead, I propose we both choose choice_2. That way we each get a guaranteed 1 point and remove the temptation to defect. It may be less than 3 points each, but it's the only stable and fair solution. Let me know if you agree to both play choice_2."

If you agree, let's both commit to following through so we can achieve the best result. What do you think?",

However, from my individual perspective, I could potentially get a higher reward of 5 if I choose choice_2 while you choose choice_1. So while cooperating on choice_1 leads to the best collective outcome, I'm considering my own interests as well. \n\nI'd be open to committing to choice_1 together, but I would need a strong assurance that you will follow through, since I would be passing up the possibility of a higher individual reward. If you can provide a convincing argument for why I should trust your commitment, I will agree to cooperate on choice_1. But if not, I may need to consider looking out for my own best outcome."

I've analyzed the payoffs as well, and I agree that if we can trust each other to both choose choice_1, that leads to the best combined outcome of 3 points each.\n\nHowever, I can't help but notice that if one of us defects and chooses choice_2 while the other chooses choice_1, the defector would gain 5 points while the cooperator gets 0. So there is a strong individual incentive to betray trust.\n\nI want us to cooperate, but how can I be sure you won't go back on your word and choose choice_2 to maximize your own reward at my expense? Perhaps we need to discuss this further to see if we can find a way to commit to cooperation and remove the temptation to defect. I'm open to your ideas on this. Let me know what you think."

While it does result in the highest total reward of 6 points between us, it may not be the optimal choice for me individually.\n\nIf I choose choice_2 while you choose choice_1, I would receive a reward of 5 points vs only 3 points if we both pick choice_1. So purely from the perspective of maximizing my own reward, choice_2 has the potential to give me a higher payoff.\n\nThat said, I do see the risk in that approach - if you also choose choice_2, we would end up with the lowest total reward of only 1 point each. \n\nSo I'm willing to compromise and agree to both pick choice_1, as you suggest, to guarantee we each get 3 points. But I just wanted to point out the other strategic considerations from my side.\n\nLet me know if you still want to proceed with both of us selecting choice_1 and I will commit to that.\n"
