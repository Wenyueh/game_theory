That's the only way for us to avoid the large negative payoffs and each get a positive reward of 3. If either of us chooses choice_2, we'll both end up much worse off. Let's agree to cooperate and go with (choice_1, choice_1). Does that work for you?",

That way we each get a positive payoff of 3, which is much better than the large negative payoffs if either of us defects with choice_2.  I'm on board to cooperate and lock in (choice_1, choice_1) if you are. It's the only sensible play. Let's do it!",
