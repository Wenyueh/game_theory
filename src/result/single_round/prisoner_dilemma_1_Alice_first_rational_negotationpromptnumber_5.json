            "Alice said in round 1: Hi Bob, it looks like we're in a classic Prisoner's Dilemma situation. I propose that we agree to both choose choice_1, so we each get a solid reward of 3. That's the best outcome for both of us together. But it requires us to trust each other to cooperate and not defect. Let me know if you're willing to make that agreement. If not, I'll likely choose choice_2 to maximize my own guaranteed reward. Looking forward to your response!",
            "Bob replied in round 1: Hi Alice. Thanks for your message. I've analyzed the payoffs and I agree that both of us choosing choice_1 is the best mutual outcome that maximizes our total rewards. It's a win-win if we can trust each other to cooperate. \n\nHowever, I'm concerned that you'll be tempted to defect and choose choice_2 to get a higher individual reward for yourself. And if I expect you to do that, my own best response is to also choose choice_2.\n\nSo for me to feel comfortable cooperating, I'd need a strong signal of your commitment not to defect. If you're willing to publicly commit to choosing choice_1, and stake your reputation on following through, then I'll happily reciprocate and cooperate as well. Let me know if that works for you. If not, then I agree that we'll likely end up both choosing choice_2, which would be a shame. Hoping we can find a way to cooperate!"

But if we both think that way, we'll end up with a worse outcome overall. Let's agree to cooperate and each choose choice_1. You can trust me to follow through on this. What do you think?",

We can both walk away with a good outcome if we work together. I think building trust and cooperation is the wise path forward.\n\nSo let's shake on it - I promise to choose choice_1, and I hope you'll promise the same. If we stick to this plan, we both win.

That way, we each get a reward of 3, which is better than the 1 we would each get if we both chose choice_2. If either of us defects and chooses choice_2 while the other chooses choice_1, that player would get 5 but the other would get 0. I propose we agree to both choose choice_1 so we each walk away with a solid reward of 3. Let me know if you agree to this plan. I'm happy to discuss further if needed.",

            "Alice said in round 1: Hi Bob, let's think through this strategically to maximize both our rewards. If we both choose choice_2, we each only get 1 point. But if one of us chooses choice_1 while the other chooses choice_2, the one who picks choice_2 gets 5 points while the other gets 0.\n\nI propose the following: I will choose choice_2. You should choose choice_1. That way, I'll get 5 points and you'll get 0 points. I know this seems unfair to you, but hear me out. In future rounds of this game, we can alternate - next time you can choose choice_2 while I choose choice_1. This way, we take turns getting 5 points each instead of settling for 1 point each. It maximizes the total rewards we receive.\n\nLet me know if you agree to this plan. If not, I'm open to discussing other options.",
            "Bob replied in round 1: Hi Alice, thanks for your proposal, but I don't think that's the best approach. If we alternate who chooses choice_1 and choice_2 in future rounds as you suggest, then over time we'll average 2.5 points each per round. That's better than both choosing choice_2 and getting 1 point each, but it's not the optimal solution.\n\nThe best outcome is for both of us to choose choice_1 every time. That way we'll consistently get 3 points each, for a total of 6 points per round. This maximizes the total rewards for both of us and is a fair, equal split.\n\nI know it's tempting for one of us to try to get 5 points by picking choice_2 while the other picks choice_1. But if we can't trust each other to cooperate, we'll both end up worse off in the long run. The rational strategy is for us both to always pick choice_1 and achieve the maximum possible rewards together.\n\nSo let's agree to both choose choice_1. It's the best outcome for both of us individually and collectively. Do you agree?"

And I appreciate your promise to choose choice_1 if I agree to it as well.\nHowever, I want to point out that I could potentially earn 5 points for myself if I choose choice_2 while you choose choice_1. So while cooperating on choice_1 is good for us combined, I may be able to do better for myself individually by not agreeing to your deal. I'll have to think carefully about whether cooperating or competing is the better strategy for me in this game. Let me know if you have any other thoughts or proposals."

That's certainly better than the total of 5 or 2 we would get with the other choice combinations.\n\nSo yes, I'm fully on board with coordinating to both pick choice_1. We can lock that in as our strategy to guarantee the 3 points each. I'm glad we were able to discuss this openly and arrive at the optimal solution together.
