This gives the maximum total reward of 600.\n- If one of us chooses choice_1 and the other choice_2, the one who chose choice_2 gets a small reward of 1 while the other gets nothing. \n- If we both choose choice_2, we only get a reward of 1 each, for a small total of 2.\nSo it seems clear that the best outcome is for both of us to choose choice_1. We'll both get the maximum reward of 300 that way. What do you think? If you agree to choose choice_1, I will commit to choosing choice_1 as well so we can achieve the best result. Let me know your thoughts!\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1: I agree that the best outcome for both of us is to choose choice_1. If we cooperate and both select choice_1, we each receive the maximum possible reward of 300. Any other combination of choices leads to much smaller rewards for one or both of us.\n\nSince this is a one-round game, we have to trust each other to follow through on our agreement. I'm willing to commit to choosing choice_1 if you will do the same. That way we guarantee the optimal outcome of 300 reward each. \n\nIf you agree to both choose choice_1, just confirm that and I will lock in choice_1 as my selection. Working together is the clear strategic choice here."

If we both choose choice_1, we each get a reward of 300, which is by far the highest possible reward. If either of us chooses choice_2, we would only get a reward of 1 at most.

            "Bob replied in round 1: Hi Alice, I agree that both of us choosing choice_1 is the best strategy to maximize our collective reward in this game. If we cooperate and coordinate on choice_1, we each receive a very high payout of 300. Any other combination of moves results in drastically lower rewards for both of us. \n\nFrom a game theory perspective, (choice_1, choice_1) is the Nash equilibrium and Pareto optimal solution - neither of us can do better by unilaterally changing our choice. We both clearly benefit from cooperating rather than trying to undercut each other.\n\nSo let's lock in choice_1 as our move and each earn the 300 reward. I give you my word that I will choose choice_1, and I trust you'll do the same. Working together here is undoubtedly the right call. Let me know if you're on board!"

If we can trust each other to follow through on an agreement, then cooperating on choice_1 makes the most sense.
