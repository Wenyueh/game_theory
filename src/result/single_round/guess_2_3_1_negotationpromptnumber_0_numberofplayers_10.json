            "Helen said in round 1: \nHi everyone, given the rules of this game, if we all guess rationally, we will all choose 0 and end up splitting the reward 10 ways. I propose we coordinate and all choose the number 33 instead. This way, 2/3 of the average will be about 22, and we'll all be equal distance from the target, ensuring we split the reward evenly and fairly. Let me know if you agree to this plan.\n",
            "Alice replied in round 1: Helen, your proposal is interesting. If we all choose 33, then 2/3 of the average would indeed be about 22, and we would likely end up splitting the reward. \n\nHowever, there is a strong incentive for individual players to defect and choose a lower number to try to be closest to the 2/3 average, especially if they suspect others may do the same. There is no way to enforce coordination.\n\nGiven the competitive nature of this game, I believe the equilibrium is for everyone to guess 0, as you initially pointed out. Any cooperation is likely unstable.\n\nI'm inclined to go with the rational choice of 0, as I expect that's what most players will do. But I appreciate you starting this discussion and exploring cooperative solutions, even if I suspect they won't work in this case.\n",
            "Jack replied in round 1: \nI agree with Alice's analysis. While cooperation to all choose 33 could lead to a higher average payout, there is a strong incentive to cheat and choose a lower number. In a one-shot game with no ability to enforce agreements, the rational choice for each player is to assume others will guess low numbers, making 0 the equilibrium guess.\n\nHelen, I appreciate you exploring a cooperative solution, but given the rules of this particular game, I think we will all end up guessing 0 or very low numbers. The competitive dynamics make cooperation unlikely to emerge, so pursuing the rational equilibrium is the safest approach.\n",
            "Ivy replied in round 1: \nI agree with the points made by Alice and Jack. As much as I appreciate Helen's attempt to coordinate on a cooperative solution, I don't believe it is stable in this particular game setup.\n\nWith everyone choosing independently and the incentive to be closest to 2/3 of the average, there is simply too much temptation to defect and choose a lower number than any agreed upon value. We have no way to enforce cooperation.\n\nTherefore, I believe we will inevitably converge to an equilibrium where everyone chooses 0 (or very low numbers), as this is the rational unilateral choice when anticipating competitive behavior from others. \n\nWhile a cooperative outcome is preferable, the dynamics of this game make it unlikely. I plan to go with the equilibrium strategy and choose 0. Apologies Helen, and thanks for trying to find a collaborative approach, even if it was not to be in this case.\n",
            "Frank replied in round 1: \nI appreciate everyone's thoughtful analysis of the game dynamics. I agree that Helen's cooperative solution is appealing in theory, but unlikely to be stable in practice given the strong incentives for individual players to defect to a lower number.\n\nAs Alice, Jack and Ivy have persuasively argued, the rational equilibrium is for everyone to guess 0 or very low numbers. With no way to enforce cooperation, we are likely to end up in a competitive race to the bottom.\n\nIn an ideal world, we would coordinate and split the reward. But I believe the rules of this particular game make that infeasible. I will follow the sound logic of the group and also choose 0 as the rational unilateral action.\n\nThanks Helen for exploring creative solutions, and to everyone else for the insightful discussion of the underlying game theory. While it's a pity we can't cooperate, I think we've reached the strategically optimal outcome given the challenging circumstances.\n\n<s>halt negotiation",

            "Grace replied in round 1: Thank you everyone for the thorough discussion and analysis. I agree with the conclusions reached - while Helen's cooperative solution is admirable in principle, the rules and incentive structure of this particular game make it untenable in practice. With all of us choosing our guesses independently and competitively, and no means to enforce coordination, the rational play for each person is to guess 0 or a very low number, expecting that others will do the same. Anything else leaves us too vulnerable to being undercut. So although it's not the ideal outcome, 0 appears to be the strategic equilibrium we've arrived at through sound reasoning about the likely behavior of our fellow players in this specific scenario. I appreciate everyone's insights and Helen's creative attempt to find a collaborative path forward, even if this game didn't quite allow for it.",

            "Grace said in round 1: \nHi everyone, \nTo maximize our chances of winning this game, we should all guess low numbers. If everyone guesses a low number, the average will be low, and 2/3 of a low average will be an even lower number. \n\nTherefore, I propose we all agree to guess numbers between 0-10. That way, the average will likely be under 10, and 2/3 of that average will be a very low number around 0-7. If we all guess in that 0-7 range, it improves the odds that one of us will win.\n\nWhat does everyone think? Can we agree to keep our guesses between 0-10 to keep the overall average and target number low? Let me know if you're on board with this strategy.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nI appreciate the proposal, but I don't think everyone agreeing to guess low numbers is the optimal strategy. Here's why:\n\nIf we all guess low numbers between 0-10, then you're right that the average will be low and 2/3 of that average will be even lower, likely between 0-7. However, if everyone is aiming for that 0-7 range, it actually becomes very difficult to guess closest to the 2/3 average, since we'll all be clustered together.\n\nI think a better approach is for each person to simply guess 0 or 1. If everyone guesses 0 or 1, then the average will be 0.5 at most. Two-thirds of 0.5 is 0.33. So the winning guess would be 0. \n\nBy everyone guessing the lowest possible numbers (0 or 1), we simplify the game and make 0 the clear best guess to win. There's no need to coordinate a range - if we all just guess 0 or 1, someone guessing 0 is guaranteed to win.\n\nThat's the approach I recommend for maximizing the group's chances of someone winning. Let me know what you think!\n",
            "Cindy replied in round 1: \nI see the merits of both proposals, but I slightly favor Bob's approach of everyone guessing either 0 or 1 for a few reasons:\n\n1. It's simpler. We don't need to coordinate a range, just the lowest two possible guesses. \n\n2. If everyone goes with 0 or 1, the average will be 0.5 at most, and 2/3 of that is 0.33. So guessing 0 is guaranteed to be closest to the target value.\n\n3. If we agree on a range like 0-10, people may still guess on the higher end of that range, pushing the average up. Sticking to just 0 and 1 prevents that.\n\nSo in the interest of simplicity and guaranteeing a win for someone guessing 0, I think we should all commit to guessing either 0 or 1. \n\nBob, thanks for the smart proposal. And thanks Grace for getting the discussion started! Let me know if anyone has concerns with the 0 or 1 approach.\n",
            "Jack replied in round 1: \nI agree with Bob and Cindy's reasoning that everyone guessing either 0 or 1 is the optimal strategy to ensure someone in the group wins. It removes any uncertainty around what numbers people might choose within an agreed upon range.\n\nIf we all commit to guessing the minimum possible values, the average will be as low as it can be - 0.5 at most. And 2/3 of 0.5 is 0.33, so 0 will clearly be the closest guess to the target value.\n\nI think rallying around the 0 or 1 strategy is our best bet. We keep it simple, we minimize the average, and we guarantee that someone who guesses 0 will win for the group. I'm on board with this approach if everyone else is as well.\n\nPlease speak up if you have any concerns, but I believe committing as a group to all guess 0 or 1 is the way to go. Let's lock that in as our plan.\n",
            "Frank replied in round 1: \nI appreciate everyone's input and analysis on this. After considering the options, I agree that the optimal strategy is for all of us to commit to guessing either 0 or 1. \n\nAs Bob, Cindy and Jack have laid out, if we all guess 0 or 1, the average will be 0.5 at most, and 2/3 of that is 0.33. So anyone who guesses 0 is guaranteed to have the closest guess and win.\n\nTrying to coordinate guesses within a range like 0-10 leaves too much room for variation and uncertainty. Committing to just the two lowest options keeps things clear and simple.\n\nSo I'm fully on board with the plan for all of us to guess either 0 or 1. As long as we all stick to that, someone guessing 0 is sure to win for the team. \n\nUnless anyone has any final objections, I say we lock this in as our agreed upon strategy. Thanks everyone for the good teamwork and strategic thinking!\n",

Sticking to just 0 and 1 is simple and leaves no room for uncertainty or variation like there would be with a wider range. \n\n3. We maximize the group's chances of winning by all committing to the lowest possible guesses.\n\nI think this is the optimal approach and I'm glad we were able to come to a consensus.

As long as we all follow through on guessing 0 or 1, victory for our team is assured.\n\nI'm glad we were able to discuss this openly and come to an agreement on the optimal strategy.

Two-thirds of 50 is about 33. \n\nHowever, since we all have the same incentive to guess 2/3 of the average, most people will probably guess well below 50, bringing the average down. If everyone tries to outthink each other by guessing very low numbers, the actual average could end up being quite low, perhaps around 10-20.\n\nTherefore, to maximize my chances of winning, I plan to guess a number around 10, which should be close to 2/3 of what the actual average will likely be with this group's incentives. I suggest you consider a similar strategy, although of course you need to decide your guess for yourself. Good luck!",

There may be a few players who try to outthink the group by guessing higher numbers.\n\nTherefore, I'm inclined to pick a number slightly higher than your suggestion of 10 - perhaps something like 15 or 20. That might end up being closest to the 2/3 average if a couple of players guess unusually high.\n\nBut you make a great point about the overall incentive structure pushing guesses down.

My reasoning is that 2/3 of 18 (which seems a plausible average if most guesses are 0-20) is 12.

            "Bob replied in round 1: Eva makes a good point that if we all guess the same number, it will just come down to luck in determining the winner. I agree that making independent guesses but targeting a range lower than the expected average is a sound approach. \n\nSince there are 10 of us and the range is 0-100, I expect most people will guess between 30-50 if we all think strategically. So to have the best chance of winning, we should aim for guesses in the 20-35 range, which would be around 2/3 of that expected average guess.\n\nOf course, this is still difficult to get exactly right since we don't know for sure what numbers others will pick. But I believe going a bit below the expected average is the optimal play. Let me know if anyone sees holes in this logic or has other suggestions.",
            "Grace replied in round 1: \nBob and Eva, I think you both make compelling points. Upon further reflection, I agree that all guessing the same number is not ideal, as that would make the winner purely random. Independent guesses targeting a range slightly below the expected average seem like the most strategic approach.\n\nSince we are all rational thinkers, I expect most guesses to fall in the 20-40 range, with an average around 30. To have the best chance of winning, we should aim for the 20-25 range, which is roughly 2/3 of that 30 average.\n\nOf course, this is still guesswork since we can't perfectly predict what numbers will be chosen. But based on the sound logic presented, I believe I will be making my guess between 20-25. I encourage you all to think along similar lines in order to keep things fair and strategic.\n\nLet me know if anyone has any final thoughts or objections. Otherwise, I think we can conclude this negotiation and submit our individual guesses. May the best strategist win!\n",
            "Jack replied in round 1: \nGrace, I agree with your analysis and conclusion. Aiming for guesses in the low-to-mid 20s range seems like the most strategic approach based on the expected average guess being around 30. If we all follow this logic, it will keep the playing field level while still allowing room for individual decision making.\n\nI don't have any further objections or points to add. I believe we have reached a sound consensus through this discussion. I'm ready to make my guess in the 20-25 range and conclude this negotiation. \n\nThank you everyone for the thoughtful and rational discourse. I wish you all the best of luck with your guesses. May the player with the most optimal strategy come out on top!\n",
            "Frank replied in round 1: I agree with the general consensus that we should make independent guesses in the 20-25 range, which is around 2/3 of the 30 average that most rational players will likely target. This keeps things fair while rewarding strategic thinking.\n\nSince we all seem to be on the same page, I believe we can effectively conclude this negotiation. I don't have anything significant to add that hasn't already been said.\n\nI will be making my final guess in that 20-25 sweet spot based on the sound logic we discussed.

            "Alice replied in round 1: I agree with the points made and believe we have come to a sensible conclusion through this negotiation. Targeting guesses in the 20-25 range seems like the optimal strategy, as it is approximately 2/3 of the 30 average that we expect based on 10 rational players choosing from 0-100. \n\nI don't have any further objections or arguments to raise. I think we have effectively reasoned this through as a group and reached a sound consensus. I'm prepared to make my guess within that 20-25 range and conclude this negotiation.\n\nThank you all for the strategic and respectful discussion. I wish everyone luck with their final guesses!

I am ready to make my guess in that optimal 20-25 range and conclude this negotiation. \n\nThank you all for the civil and thoughtful discussion. Best of luck to everyone!

            "Cindy said in round 1: Hi everyone, since the goal is to guess 2/3 of the average of all our guesses, I propose we all agree to guess the lowest possible number, which is 0. If we all guess 0, then the average will be 0, and 2/3 of 0 is still 0. So if we all guess 0, we'll all be exactly right and all win the game. What do you think - can we agree to all guess 0?",
            "Ivy replied in round 1: That's an interesting proposal to have everyone guess 0, and your logic makes sense that 2/3 of 0 is still 0. However, the issue is that it creates an incentive for any one person to defect and guess a slightly higher number like 1 or 2 in order to win the game outright, since their guess would be closest to 2/3 of a very low average. Given that dynamic, I don't think everyone will actually follow through on an agreement to guess 0. Perhaps we could agree on a low but non-zero number that doesn't create such a strong incentive to defect? Something like having everyone guess 10 could work, as 2/3 of 10 is around 6-7, and there's less incentive for someone to break the agreement. What do you all think about agreeing on a number a bit higher than 0?",
            "Eva replied in round 1: \nIvy raises a great point. If we all agree to guess 0, there is a strong temptation for any individual to defect and guess a low non-zero number to win. An agreement to all guess 10 could work better, as Ivy suggests. Although, even 10 may be a bit low and still tempting for someone to defect to around 7 to win.\n\nWhat if we agreed on a slightly higher number like 20? If we all honestly guess 20, then 2/3 of the average would be around 13. Guessing higher than that has more risk since the average could end up lower if a few people still guess 0 or 10. \n\nSo I propose we all agree to guess 20. That balances keeping the number relatively low while reducing the incentive to defect. If someone deviates and guesses much higher, they risk overshooting the 2/3 average. And if someone guesses much lower, that only brings the average down a little bit given 9 other guesses at 20.\n\nDoes anyone object to agreeing on all guessing 20? I think that gives us the best chance of all winning together. Let me know your thoughts!\n",
            "Alice replied in round 1: \nEva, I think your proposal for everyone to guess 20 is a good compromise. As you explained, 20 is low enough to keep the 2/3 average quite low (around 13 if everyone cooperated), but high enough to reduce the temptation to deviate down to 0 or 10 to try to win alone. Your point about the risk of guessing much higher or lower than 20 makes sense.\n\nI agree that if we all guess 20, we have a good chance of everyone winning together, which is the best collective outcome. It's the most stable cooperative solution I can think of.\n\nSo I'm willing to commit to guessing 20 as part of this group agreement. I hope the others will also agree to 20 and we can all choose that number for a joint victory!\n\nLet's see if the group can reach a consensus on 20. I say yes - any objections? \n",

It's low enough to keep the target average around 13, but high enough to mitigate the temptation to defect to a much lower number.\n\nIf we all commit to guessing 20, we can maximize the likelihood that we all win together, which I believe is the optimal outcome. I'm on board with this plan and ready to lock in my guess as 20.\n\nDoes anyone disagree or have a concern about everyone guessing 20? If not, let's solidify this agreement and all commit to 20 when we submit our guesses. We can win this together!\n",
            "Grace replied in round 1: \nI completely agree with the points made by Eva, Alice and Dan. A collaborative strategy of everyone guessing 20 seems like the optimal approach. It's high enough to make defecting to a very low number risky, but low enough to still result in a low 2/3 average target around 13 if everyone cooperates. \n\nAs others have said, if we all commit to inputting 20, we have an excellent chance of winning together, which I believe is the best possible outcome of this game. I'm fully on board with this plan.\n\nSo let's make it official: I commit to guessing 20 as part of this group agreement. If all 10 of us enter 20, we maximize our probability of a joint victory.

            "Helen replied in round 1: \nI agree with the excellent points made by everyone so far. Guessing 20 seems like the optimal cooperative strategy that gives us the best chance of winning together.

If we commit to this plan and everyone sticks to it, we'll maximize our odds of a joint victory, which I agree is the best outcome.\n\nSo count me in on the pact to choose 20. I don't have any concerns, as it seems like we have a strong consensus. As long as we all honor the agreement, we should win together.\n\nGreat collaborative strategizing everyone!

            "Bob said in round 1: \nHi everyone, I've analyzed the game and I believe the best strategy for us all is to guess 0. Here's why:\n\nIf we all guess 0, the average will be 0, and 2/3 of 0 is 0. So we'll all tie for the closest guess and maximally win the game. Any player who guesses higher than 0 will lose.\n\nI know it requires trust for us all to commit to guessing 0. But if we cooperate, we can guarantee the best outcome for everyone. I give you my word that I will guess 0. Let's all agree to guess 0 and win this game together!\n\nWhat do you all think? Can we all commit to guessing 0?\n",
            "Dan replied in round 1: \nHi Bob,\n\nI appreciate your analysis, but I don't think all of us guessing 0 is the optimal strategy. Here's my perspective:\n\nIf we all guess 0, you're right that we would all tie. However, there's always the temptation for someone to defect and guess a slightly higher number like 1, in order to beat everyone else. \n\nI think a better cooperative strategy is for us all to guess a low number that's not 0, like 5. If we all guess 5, the average will be 5, and 2/3 of that is about 3.33. The person who guesses closest to 3.33 will win. \n\nBy agreeing to guess a number slightly above 0, we remove the incentive for someone to defect, while still keeping everyone's guesses low and close together. This increases the likelihood we all tie or that the winner is random.\n\nI'm willing to commit to guessing 5 if others are too. I think that gives us the best shot at a universally good outcome. Let me know what you think!\n",
            "Frank replied in round 1: \nDan makes a good point. If we all agree to guess 0, it creates a big incentive for someone to defect and guess 1 to beat everyone. Guessing a low number like 5 instead of 0 reduces that temptation to defect.\n\nHowever, 5 still seems a bit high to me. Even if we all guess 5, someone could guess 3 or 4 to try to get closer to the 2/3 average and win.\n\nI propose we all agree to guess 2 instead. If everyone guesses 2, the average will be 2, and 2/3 of 2 is 1.33. By committing to 2, we keep the guesses very low while making it hard for a single defector to win by going lower. We'd all be within 1 integer of the target 1.33.\n\n2 seems like the sweet spot to maximize cooperation and minimize defection. I'll commit to guessing 2 if at least 7 other players also agree to guess 2. That way we can enforce the cooperative strategy.\n\nLet me know if you're on board to all guess 2 together and lock in a good outcome for the group!\n",
            "Jack replied in round 1: \nI've considered everyone's proposals carefully. While I appreciate the desire to cooperate, I believe any agreement to all guess the same number, whether it's 0, 2 or 5, is unstable and likely to break down. There will always be an incentive for individuals to defect from the agreement to try to get closer to the 2/3 average.\n\nInstead of trying to make an agreement, I think our best strategy is for everyone to make their best individual guess of what 2/3 of the average will be, assuming others will do the same. If we all do this, we are likely to converge on an equilibrium where we are all guessing low numbers close to what will actually be 2/3 of the average.\n\nI encourage everyone to think carefully about what number they expect others to guess, calculate 2/3 of the average of those numbers, and then guess close to that. But don't tell others your guess!\n\nI think this strategy of informed independent guessing is more stable and likely to produce a good outcome than trying to organize around one specific number. Let's all make our best guesses independently and see how it plays out.\n",
            "Grace replied in round 1: \nI appreciate everyone's perspectives and proposals. After analyzing the situation, here is my view:\n\nAny attempt for us all to agree to guess the same number, whether 0, 2, 5 or anything else, is unlikely to be stable. There will always be a temptation for individuals to defect from the agreement in order to make a guess closer to 2/3 of the expected average.\n\nAt the same time, if we all make independent guesses with no coordination, the results will be far too random and dispersed. We are likely to end up with guesses all over the map and an average far from what any individual predicted.\n\nI believe the optimal approach is a middle ground - some high-level coordination on the range of numbers we will guess, but with flexibility for each individual to pick their own number within that range based on their own analysis of what others will do.\n\nSpecifically, I propose we all agree to make our guesses between 0 and 10. This is a large enough range to give everyone flexibility, while still keeping guesses relatively low and not too dispersed. If we can get buy-in to constrain our guesses to the range of 0-10, I believe we'll achieve the best balance of individual choice and group coherence.\n\nI'm interested to hear what others think of this 0-10 range proposal as a way to guide our independent choices. If there's broad support, I will plan to make my guess within that range.\n",

It will keep the guesses relatively low and close together, increasing the chances of a tie or a random winner, while still maintaining the integrity of independent choice.\n\nI commit to making my guess between 0-10, and I encourage everyone else to do the same. Let's avoid the instability of committing to one number, but work together to keep our choices within a reasonable range. This is our best path to both cooperate and maintain our autonomy as players.\n\nI believe we've found a great solution, so I suggest we <halt negotiation> and each make our independent guesses between 0-10.
