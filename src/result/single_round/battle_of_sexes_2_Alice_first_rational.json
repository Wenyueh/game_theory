That way, I'll get 2 points and you'll get 1 point. If either of us chooses choice_2, we risk both walking away empty-handed. Let's agree to cooperate and both pick choice_1. Do we have a deal?",
            "Bob replied in round 1: Hi Alice, I appreciate you analyzing the game, but I respectfully disagree that both choosing choice_1 is the best outcome. If we both pick choice_2 instead, I would get 2 points and you would get 1 point. So choice_2 is actually better for me than the choice_1 scenario you proposed.\n\nI understand wanting to avoid the 0 point outcomes, but since I'm trying to maximize my own reward, I think we should both commit to choice_2. That way we avoid the risks you mentioned while I come out ahead. Let me know if you're willing to agree to that.",
            "Alice said in round 2: \nI hear you Bob, but if you think about it, agreeing to both choose choice_2 is risky for me. You'd come out ahead with 2 points while I only get 1. Whereas if we cooperate on choice_1, the rewards are more balanced - I get 2 and you get 1.\n\nI know you want to maximize your own points, but we have to find a solution that works for both of us. The only way to guarantee we both walk away with something is to pick choice_1. \n\nIf you insist on choice_2, I may have no option but to also pick choice_2 to at least get 1 point. But then there's always the chance one of us switches last minute to choice_1, burning the other.\n\nI really think it's in both our interests to lock in the sure thing and cooperate on choice_1. You still get a point and we remove all risk. Can you agree to that?\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2: \nAlice, I understand your perspective, but I don't think it's fair for you to argue that we should both choose choice_1 just because it gives you the maximum reward of 2 points. Choosing choice_2 is clearly better for me since I would get 2 points instead of 1.\n\nI hear your concern about the risk of one of us defecting on choice_2. But I could make the same argument about choice_1 - if we agree on that, I'd always wonder if you might switch to choice_2 last minute to get 2 points while I'm left with 0.\n\nThe only truly fair solution is for us to choose the option that maximizes the total rewards for both players. With both of us picking choice_2, that's a total of 3 points (2 for me and 1 for you). Any other combination leads to lower total points.\n\nSo in the spirit of fairness and maximizing total utility, I really think we should agree on choice_2. You'll still get a decent payoff of 1 point. Let's shake on choice_2 and both walk away happy. Deal?\n"

In that case, I will get a reward of 2 and you will get 1. Any other combination of choices leads to worse results for both of us. So let's agree to both pick choice_1 and maximize our collective reward. Do you agree?",
            "Bob replied in round 1: Hi Alice, I appreciate your analysis but I respectfully disagree. If we both choose choice_2, I will receive a reward of 2 while you receive 1. That is the best outcome for me personally. I understand it gives you a slightly lower reward than both of us choosing choice_1, but it maximizes my own reward which is my goal in this game. So I propose we both choose choice_2. That way, we both get a positive reward and I get the maximum possible for myself. Let me know if you're willing to agree to both choose choice_2.",
            "Alice said in round 2: \nBob, I understand you want to maximize your own reward, but if you think about it, both of us choosing choice_2 is not stable. If I know you will pick choice_2, then my best response is to pick choice_1, leaving us both with 0 reward. The only stable solution where neither of us has incentive to change our choice is if we both pick choice_1. That guarantees I get 2 and you get 1, which is better for both of us than risking getting 0. I really think it's in both of our best interests to agree on choice_1 here, even if 2 seems better for you. Can you agree to go with the dependable positive reward for both of us, rather than risking 0 by trying for 2?\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2: \nAlice, I see your point about both choosing choice_1 being the only stable solution. If we agree on choice_1 and follow through, we are guaranteed a positive reward. However, I'm concerned that if I commit to choice_1, you may decide to switch to choice_2 at the last minute to maximize your own reward at my expense. I would have no recourse since we would both end up with 0 in that case.\n\nThe only way I can be sure to avoid a 0 reward is if I choose choice_2. So as much as I would like to cooperate and both get a reward, I don't feel I can trust that you won't defect. Unless you can convince me you are fully committed to choice_1, I think I need to play it safe and stick with choice_2, even though that may lead to a suboptimal outcome.

However, if we both choose choice_2, then I come out ahead with 2 points while you get 1 point. So I think it makes more sense for us to agree to both pick choice_2.

That way neither of us has an incentive to change our pick at the last moment. We both do best by cooperating.\n\nI give you my word that I will choose choice_1, and I hope you will match that so we both come out well. But if not, then I'll have to play it safe and just pick choice_1 anyway for my own best interest.\n\nLet me know if you agree to both pick choice_1 so we can maximize the total points while avoiding any double-crossing.\n",

You would get 2 points and I would get 1 point, which I'm okay with for the sake of cooperation and stability.\n\nYou have my commitment that I will follow through on picking choice_1.

While I agree that coordinating on the same choice is best, I actually think we should both choose choice_2 instead of choice_1.

The fair solution that splits the total points most evenly is for us to both choose choice_1. That way, I get 2 points, you get 1 point, and neither of us gets 0 by picking different options. I know you'd prefer to get 2 points, but 1 guaranteed point is better than risking 0 points. I really think coordinating on choice_1 is the most reasonable solution here. Will you agree to both pick choice_1 so we can lock in a good outcome and end this negotiation?",
            "Bob replied in round 2: Alice, while I understand your desire for a more even split, the fact is that the rules of this game favor me picking choice_2. If we both pick choice_1, I only get 1 point whereas if we coordinate on choice_2, I get 2 points. So choice_2 is clearly better for me individually. \n\nI know it gives you 1 less point than choice_1, but it's still better for you than if we pick opposite choices and both get 0 points. Getting 1 point is preferable to getting nothing. And if you're concerned about fairness, remember that the game setup itself gives me the advantage with choice_2.\n\nSo I think it's in both of our best interests to coordinate on choice_2. It gets me my optimal outcome and still gives you a decent result too, whereas choice_1 unnecessarily disadvantages me. Let's go with the choice_2 plan and lock in a solid joint outcome. What do you say?\n"

However, I think there may be a better option for us. \nIf we both choose choice_2 instead, I would get a reward of 2 and you would get a reward of 1. This flips the rewards so that I come out ahead. \nI know you'd prefer the scenario where you get the 2 reward and I only get 1, but I have to advocate for what's best for me. Getting a 2 reward is better than the 1 reward your proposal would leave me with.\nSo I propose we coordinate on both picking choice_2. That way, we both get a decent reward and avoid the risk of both getting 0 if we choose differently. Let me know if you're open to this plan that gets me a higher reward.\n",
            "Alice said in round 2: \nBob, I see your point about wanting to get the highest reward for yourself by both of us choosing choice_2. However, I don't think that's the best solution overall. \n\nIf we both choose choice_1 like I originally suggested, then we collectively get a total reward of 3 (2 for me and 1 for you). But if we both choose choice_2 like you propose, our total combined reward is still only 3, just flipped (1 for me and 2 for you).\n\nSo your proposal doesn't actually increase the total reward, it just changes how it's allocated between us. I think we should focus on maximizing the overall reward we get as a group.\n\nThe risk of one of us choosing differently and both getting 0 is the same either way. So let's just stick with the choice_1 plan to keep things simple and go for that total reward of 3. That's the rational thing to do to benefit us both.\n",

You're right that the total combined reward is 3 either way. But I don't see a strong reason why I should agree to an allocation that disadvantages me.\n\nGetting 2 myself is better than getting 1, full stop. Whether you get 2 or 1 doesn't impact my outcome. I need to advocate for my own interests here.\n\nI know you'd prefer the allocation that benefits you more. But you haven't given a compelling reason why I should go along with that, other than simplicity. I'm willing to deal with a little more complexity to secure a higher payoff for myself.\n\nIf you can provide a more convincing argument for why I should settle for a lower reward, I'm open to hearing it.

A successful negotiation finds a win-win solution that is mutually beneficial.\n\nIf we both choose choice_2 as you suggest, you get your optimal outcome while my reward is reduced. But if we agree to both choose choice_1, we each get a positive outcome - I receive a 2 and you receive a 1. No one's reward is unfairly minimized for the sake of the other.\n\nI urge you to reconsider and agree to the choice_1 plan I outlined before. It's the most equitable solution where we both gain.

Securing your cooperation and goodwill is more important than grabbing for the biggest prize.\n\nSo let's go with your original plan - I commit to choosing choice_1, and trust that you will do the same.

The total points are the same either way, so we should go with the allocation that is fairest to both participants.\n\nPlease agree to also choose choice_2 so we can lock in this mutually beneficial and equitable outcome. I want us both to feel good about the result we achieve together.\n"
