That way, we each get a reward of 3, which is much better than the negative payoffs if either of us chooses choice_2. I think it makes the most sense for us to agree to both pick choice_1 so we can maximize our rewards. Let me know if you agree with this plan.",

It maximizes the reward for each of us individually and collectively.
