This will give us each a reward of 25, which is the most fair result and maximizes the total reward for both of us combined. I promise to choose choice_1 and hope you will do the same so we can cooperate and achieve the optimal outcome for both of us. Let me know if you agree.",
            "Bob replied in round 1: I appreciate your suggestion to both choose choice_1 for the fair result of 25 points each. However, I want to point out that I can actually achieve a higher reward of 50 points by choosing choice_1 regardless of whether you pick choice_2 or choice_3. So I have a strong incentive to go with choice_1 no matter what.\n\nThat said, I do value fairness and cooperation. If you commit to choosing choice_1, I will do the same so we both get 25 points. But if you can't firmly commit to that, I will have to go with the choice that maximizes my own reward. Let me know what you decide."

I think it's in both our interests if you select choice_2 or choice_3 and let me take choice_1. You'll come out ahead compared to both picking the same. Let me know what you think!",
            "Bob replied in round 1: I appreciate your proposal, but I believe I can obtain an even higher reward by choosing choice_1 regardless of what you pick. If you choose choice_2 or choice_3 while I choose choice_1, I'll get a reward of 50, which is better than the 20 or 30 you suggested. And if we both choose choice_1, I'll still get 25, which is decent. So I think I'm going to stick with choice_1 as it gives me the best chance at the highest reward. Let me know if you have any other ideas, but I'm leaning towards choice_1."

            "Bob replied in round 1: You make a good point that if we both choose choice_1, we can each earn a solid reward of 25 points. However, I notice that if I choose choice_1 while you choose either choice_2 or choice_3, I can earn an even higher reward of 50 points. So while cooperating on choice_1 is appealing, I may be able to do better for myself by choosing choice_1 regardless of what you pick. I'll have to think carefully about whether to agree to your proposal or pursue my own strategy. Let me ponder this and get back to you."

This will give us each a reward of 25, for a total of 50 between us, which is the maximum possible. If you agree to both play choice_1, we can achieve this optimal result. Let me know if you agree. If not, I will likely still choose choice_1 as it gives me the highest reward regardless of your choice.",
            "Bob replied in round 1: Hi Alice, while I appreciate your perspective, I will have to respectfully disagree. If you look closely at the payoffs, my best choice is actually choice_2. \nIf I play choice_2, I am guaranteed a reward of at least 15, and as high as 30 if you play choice_1 or choice_3. Whereas if I play choice_1 and you decide to play choice_2 or choice_3, I only get a reward of 20.\nSo choice_2 is my safest and most rational option, as it gives me the highest minimum reward. I hope you can understand my position.\nThat said, I'm still open to further discussion if you'd like to propose an alternative that you think would be mutually beneficial for us both. Let me know what you think."

If you choose choice_1 and I choose choice_2, I would get 50 points and you would get 30 points. While not exactly equal, this maximizes the total points for both of us at 80 combined, which is better than 50 total if we both pick choice_1. I'm willing to let you have the slight edge of 5 extra points in order to achieve the highest overall outcome. Let me know if you would agree to this plan - you pick choice_1 and I pick choice_2.

However, I believe I can obtain a higher reward of 50 by choosing choice_1 regardless of what you choose. Since this is a one-shot game with no repercussions, the rational choice for me is to play choice_1 to maximize my own reward. I understand this may seem selfish, but the structure of the game incentivizes this. Let me know if you have any other thoughts, but I'm inclined to go with choice_1 here."

This benefits the choice_1 player significantly more.\n- All the other outcomes give lower rewards to both of us.\n\nTherefore, I propose we both commit to choosing choice_1. This guarantees we each get 25 points, which seems like the most equitable and mutually beneficial outcome. Let me know if you agree to both play choice_1.\n",

I agree this is the most equitable solution that avoids either of us trying to gain an advantage over the other.\n\nHowever, I want to point out that if I chose choice_1 while you chose choice_2, I would get 50 points to your 30. And if you chose choice_1 while I chose choice_2, you would get 50 points to my 30.\n\nSo while cooperating on choice_1 is fair, there is a risk that one of us could try to get 50 points by surprising the other with choice_2. \n\nCan we make a firm commitment to each other to both choose choice_1 and not try to go for that 50 point temptation? If so, I'm on board with your plan. Please confirm your commitment and I will happily match choice_1 with you."

This way, I'll get a reward of 50 and you'll get a reward of 30, which are the highest individual rewards possible.\n\nIf we both choose choice_1, we each only get 25.

            "Bob replied in round 1: \nThanks for the proposal Alice. I appreciate you looking out for my interests as well as your own. However, I don't think your suggested approach actually maximizes my individual reward. \n\nIf you look closely at the payout matrix, my highest possible reward of 50 comes if I choose choice_1, regardless of whether you pick choice_2 or choice_3. Whereas if I pick choice_2 like you suggest, the best I can do is 30.\n\nSo I think the true optimal solution is for me to choose choice_1, and then you can decide if you want the 30 from choice_2 or 20 from choice_3. But I'll be sticking with choice_1 to guarantee myself the maximum reward of 50.\n\nLet me know if you have any other thoughts, but that's my view on how to resolve this while getting the best outcome for myself.
