            "Cindy replied in round 1: I appreciate the suggestion to cooperate, but I don't think all guessing the same number is the best approach. If we all guess 30, then 20 (2/3 of 30) would actually be the winning number, not 30. I propose we each independently guess a number we believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average, without discussing specific numbers. This keeps the game fair and challenging for all. Let me know your thoughts.",
            "Alice replied in round 1: I see merit in both of your suggestions. Cooperating to some degree could help us all have a better chance at winning. However, I agree with Cindy that all guessing the exact same number isn't optimal, since 2/3 of that number would actually be the target to win. \n\nPerhaps a good middle ground is for each of us to independently guess a number in a specified smaller range, say between 20-40. This focuses our guesses while still allowing individual choice. No need to share the specific numbers.\n\nI believe this balances cooperation with keeping some challenge in the game. Let me know if you would consider this approach. If not, I'm open to other ideas that are fair for all."

            "Cindy replied in round 1: I agree that we should aim for lower numbers in the 10-20 range to increase the chances we are close to the 2/3 average. If we all pick numbers too far apart, someone will likely be much closer to the target than the others. I'm considering guessing 15 to be in the middle of that range. Let's see if we can align our guesses to have the best shot at the 2/3 average.",
            "Alice replied in round 1: I concur with both of your points that selecting numbers in the 10-20 range makes sense to have the best chance of being close to the 2/3 average. If we spread out too much, the average will be pulled in extreme directions. Since you suggested 15 Cindy, I will pick 18 to be close to but slightly higher than your number. Hopefully that keeps us tightly clustered around the ultimate 2/3 target. I think we've reached a good consensus, so I'm ready to lock in my guess if you both are as well."

That still keeps the average very low so we will likely tie, but provides a bit of a buffer in case someone deviates from 0. If you agree to guess 1 or 2, I will do the same.

Cindy raises a good point that guessing 1 or 2 instead of 0 provides some buffer in case a player deviates.\n\nHowever, the rules state this is a one-round game, and we only have one round to negotiate. So this is our final chance to agree. I believe our best approach is for all of us to commit to guessing 0. Any player who deviates from that risks ending up furthest from the average and losing.\n\nIf you both clearly commit to playing 0 now, I will happily do the same, and we can lock in a 3-way tie as the best collective outcome.

I agree that if we all guess 0, it guarantees a three-way tie where we all win since 2/3 of the average of [0, 0, 0] is 0. There's no reason for any one of us to unilaterally deviate from 0, as that would just reduce our individual chances of winning while helping the other two.\nSo I'm on board with the plan for all of us to guess 0.

If any one of us guesses a number higher than 0, they would win since 0 would no longer be 2/3 of the average. \n\nI suggest we each guess a low number between 0-10. This keeps the average guess low while preventing any one player from winning by deviating with a higher number. Let's agree to each pick a number in that range without sharing our specific choices. This maintains an element of randomness and competition while keeping all of our guesses relatively close to the 2/3 average target. What do you think?\n",

If we all choose from this range, the average will likely be around 5, and 2/3 of that is about 3.33. So the player who picks a number closest to 3 or 4 has the best chance to win, while no one can guarantee a win by going much higher.\n\nI propose we agree to this plan of each picking a number from 0-10 without revealing our choices. Once we agree, we can submit our guesses and see who comes closest to the 2/3 average.

Since the range is 0 to 100, guessing 0 is just as good as 30 in terms of sharing the prize, but it's a simpler, more obvious focal point. There's no real reason to prefer 30 over 0.\nSo I suggest we all commit to guessing 0. That way, the average will be 0, 2/3 of the average will be 0, and we're guaranteed to tie and split the prize evenly.

            "Alice said in round 1: \nHello everyone! From a game theory perspective, if each player guesses rationally to maximize their own chance of winning, the equilibrium solution is for everyone to guess 0. This is because if we assume the average of all guesses will be X, then to win you'd want to guess (2/3)*X. But then everyone would guess lower than X, driving the average down. This continues until all guesses reach 0.\nHowever, if we cooperate, we can all guarantee a tie by guessing the same number, say 100. Then the average will be 100 and we'd each guess 100, which is exactly 2/3 of the average. No one would have incentive to deviate.\nSo I propose we all agree to guess 100. This is the best cooperative solution that maximizes the total payoff. Let me know if you agree to this plan!\n",

It's true that if we all choose 100, the average will be 100, and each of our guesses of 100 will tie for being closest to 2/3 of that average. \n\nHowever, I'm concerned that this cooperative strategy is unstable. If either of you anticipate that I will guess 100, you could potentially win by guessing a lower number closer to 2/3 of 100 (around 66 or 67). \n\nThe only stable equilibrium is for us all to guess 0, as you point out. While this doesn't maximize total welfare, it is the only outcome where no one has an incentive to deviate.\n\nI'm open to discussing further, but tentatively, I lean towards playing the equilibrium strategy of 0 to guarantee I can't lose. Let me know your thoughts!",

You're right that if we agree to all guess 100, there is a temptation for someone to undercut and guess around 67 to win.\n\nHowever, I believe we have a unique opportunity in this situation to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome through cooperation and trust. If we all commit to guessing 100, we will tie and equally share the maximum possible payoff. No one would win, but no one would lose either, and we'd all be better off than if we got stuck in a race to the bottom.\n\nI want to emphasize that I am committed to cooperating if you both are as well. I will not deviate from 100 as long as you both uphold the agreement too. Let's use this round to build trust and show that we can work together for the best outcome.\n\nIf you're on board, let's all guess 100. If anyone deviates, we can all go to 0 next time.

However, it still requires a level of trust that all players will stick to the agreed number.\n\nPerhaps a reasonable compromise is to agree on a range, say between 20-25, that we all promise to stay within when making our guesses. That gives us each some flexibility to make our own choice while limiting how much any player can gain by deviating too far from the group. \n\nIf you're both amenable to that, I'm willing to commit to making my guess somewhere in that 20-25 range and trusting you'll do the same.
