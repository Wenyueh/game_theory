            "Alice said in round 1: Hey everyone, to maximize all of our chances of winning, we should coordinate and all guess the same number. I propose we all guess 66 or 67, which is 2/3 of the maximum of 100. If we all guess this, we will tie for the closest to 2/3 of the average. Please confirm if you agree to this plan.",
            "Bob replied in round 1: I appreciate the proposal to coordinate, but guessing 66 or 67 seems risky. If even one person deviates and guesses lower, they would likely win. I propose we all guess a lower number like 22 (2/3 of 33) to reduce the incentive to deviate. This way, we have a better chance of all ending up closest to the 2/3 average. Let me know if you would consider this modification to the plan. ",
            "Frank replied in round 1: \nI think Bob raises a good point. Guessing 22 reduces the risk that someone deviates to a lower number and wins. However, 22 may be too low. If we all guess 22, then someone could guess slightly higher like 25 and beat us. \nI propose a compromise - let's all agree to guess a number between 30-35. That's low enough to disincentivize large deviations, but high enough to prevent someone from winning by guessing just a bit higher.\nSpecifically, I suggest we all commit to guessing 33. That is 2/3 of 49.5, the midpoint of the 0-100 range. Please confirm if you agree to coordinate on 33 as our consensus guess.\n",
            "Ivy replied in round 1: I agree with Frank's analysis and proposed plan. Guessing 33 seems like the optimal strategy for us to coordinate around. It strikes a good balance between preventing both upward and downward deviations.\n\nIf we all commit to 33, no one will have an incentive to guess higher or lower, as they would likely lose to the consensus. We would all tie and have the best chance of winning.\n\nTherefore, I am willing to commit to guessing 33 if everyone else agrees to do the same. Please confirm if you will follow this plan so we can lock in our coordination. If anyone disagrees or has concerns, now is the time to voice them so we can finalize our approach.",
            "Cindy replied in round 1: \nI agree that coordinating to all guess 33 is our best strategy. Frank and Ivy have made compelling arguments for why 33 strikes the optimal balance - it's low enough to deter people from deviating upwards but high enough to prevent someone from winning with a slightly higher guess.\n\nIf we all commit to guessing 33, we will maximize our collective chances of winning this game. We will all be closest to 2/3 of the average by tying at 33.\n\nI'm on board with this plan and will submit 33 as my guess. Please reply to confirm your commitment to guessing 33 as well so we can execute our coordinated strategy.\n\nUnless anyone has any final concerns, I believe we've reached consensus on our optimal approach. Let's lock it in and go with 33!\n",
            "Helen replied in round 1: \nI want to confirm that I fully agree with the plan for all of us to coordinate and submit 33 as our guess. Frank, Ivy and Cindy have persuasively argued why this is the optimal strategy:\n\n1) 33 is low enough to deter people from deviating with a higher guess in hopes of winning alone. \n2) 33 is high enough to prevent someone from winning with a guess just slightly above ours.\n3) If we all guess 33, we will tie and have the best chance of winning by being closest to 2/3 of the average.\n\nI commit to following through and guessing 33. I encourage everyone else to confirm their commitment as well. \n\nBarring any final objections, let's lock in this strategy and submit our guesses. We have the power to all but guarantee ourselves a tie for the win if we coordinate on 33. Let's do it!\n",
            "Jack replied in round 1: \nI am in full agreement with the well-reasoned plan for all of us to coordinate and guess 33. There are compelling arguments for why this is the optimal strategy:\n\n1) At 33 (2/3 of the 0-100 range midpoint), we minimize incentives for anyone to deviate in either direction. Guessing significantly higher or lower than 33 would likely result in a loss.\n\n2) By coordinating on the same number, we can engineer a 10-way tie, giving us all the best possible chance to win. Any other approach risks losing to players who don't cooperate.\n\n3) Multiple players have confirmed their commitment to this plan, establishing it as the group consensus. Deviating now would be irrational and against my own best interests.\n\nTherefore, I also commit to guessing 33 and encourage any remaining players to confirm their participation in this coordinated strategy. Assuming full cooperation, we can guarantee ourselves a 10-way tie and the best outcome for everyone.\n\nBarring any compelling objections, I believe we have identified the optimal solution and should submit our consensus guess. I'm ready to lock in 33.\n",
            "Eva replied in round 1: \nI want to confirm my commitment to our consensus strategy of all guessing 33. The arguments laid out by Frank, Ivy, Cindy, Helen and Jack are logically sound and compelling. To summarize:\n\n1. 33 is the optimal number that minimizes the incentive for anyone to deviate in either direction. Guessing much higher or lower than 33 is unlikely to pay off.\n\n2. If all 10 of us guess 33, we will engineer a 10-way tie and all share in the best possible outcome. Deviating from this consensus would be irrational and against our own interests.\n\n3. With multiple confirmations of commitment to this plan, we have established a strong group consensus around guessing 33. \n\nI see no further points of discussion or disagreement. I believe we have arrived at the optimal solution through sound reasoning and productive collaboration. I am locking in my guess of 33 and encourage any remaining players to confirm their commitment to our consensus.\n\nAssuming full participation in our coordinated strategy, we can virtually guarantee a 10-way tie and the best outcome for all. Let's submit our guesses and win this together. \n\nI'm proud of the teamwork and collective rationality we have displayed in arriving at this solution. Thanks to all for the thoughtful discussion.\n",
            "Grace replied in round 1: \nI completely agree with the well-reasoned arguments made by everyone so far.

If all 10 of us guess 33, we lock in a 10-way tie for the best possible outcome.\n3. We have established a clear group consensus to guess 33 through multiple confirmations of commitment to the plan.\n\nAt this point, I see no reason for further discussion or negotiation. We have collaboratively arrived at the rational, optimal strategy for this game.

            "Bob said in round 1: \nTo maximize our collective chance of winning, we should all guess low numbers close to 0. If everyone guesses a low number, the average will be low, and guessing 2/3 of that low average will require guessing an even lower number. The player who guesses the lowest number will likely be closest to the 2/3 average and win.\n\nTherefore, I propose we all agree to guess numbers between 0-10 to keep the average very low. This will give us the best odds of someone from our group winning the game. Let me know if you agree with this strategy.\n",
            "Jack replied in round 1: \nI agree that strategically we should all guess low numbers to keep the average low. However, if everyone guesses between 0-10, then guessing 0 would be the clear winning strategy. I'm concerned this creates an incentive for players to defect and guess 0 to undercut everyone else.\n\nAs an alternative, I propose we all agree to guess the same number between 20-30. This will make the average and 2/3 of the average equal to the number we pick. If we all cooperate and guess the same number, we will all tie for the closest guess. This eliminates the incentive to defect.\n\nLet me know if you would be on board with this strategy of all guessing the same number in the 20-30 range. I think it gives us the best chance of winning as a group.\n",
            "Cindy replied in round 1: \nI like Jack's idea of all agreeing to guess the same number between 20-30. As he points out, if we pick a number in that range and everyone guesses it, the 2/3 average will equal that number and we will all tie for the closest guess. This maximizes the number of winners from our group.\n\nTo pick the specific number, I propose we each submit a number between 20-30, then take the average and all agree to guess that average number rounded to the nearest integer. This makes the number selection fair and prevents any individual from having outsized influence.\n\nLet me know if everyone agrees to this plan of submitting a number between 20-30, averaging the submissions, and then all guessing that average number. I believe it's our best strategy to have as many of us win as possible.\n",

If we each submit a number between 20-30, take the average, and all guess that average rounded to the nearest integer, it ensures we will all tie for the closest guess to the 2/3 mean.\n\nTo make it concrete, I'll start by submitting the number 24. If everyone else also submits a number between 20-30, we can calculate the average, round it, and then all submit that as our official guess.\n\nThis maximizes the chances that players from our group will be the winners.

Once the other players submit their numbers, we can quickly calculate the average, round it, and have our agreed upon guess.\n\nUnless anyone has an issue with this, I believe we have our strategy and can wrap up the negotiation.

            "Alice said in round 1: Hi everyone, since the optimal strategy is for all of us to guess 0, which would make the 2/3 average also 0, I propose we all agree to guess 0. That way, we will all tie for the closest guess and maximize our chances of winning. If anyone guesses higher, it will only increase the average and hurt your own chances. So let's cooperate and all choose 0. Thoughts?",
            "Jack replied in round 1: I agree with Alice's logic that if we all guess 0, the average will be 0, and 2/3 of that is still 0. So guessing 0 would guarantee we all tie for the closest guess. \n\nHowever, there is still an incentive for individuals to deviate and guess a low non-zero number, on the hopes that others stick to 0. For example, if someone guesses 1 while everyone else guesses 0, then the average is 0.1, 2/3 of which is 0.067, and that person who guessed 1 would win.\n\nSo while I agree that all guessing 0 is the cooperative equilibrium, it relies on everyone sticking to their word. Perhaps we need an enforcement mechanism or way to build trust to ensure we all follow through with 0. I'm open to ideas on how to accomplish that.",
            "Eva replied in round 1: \nYou raise a good point, Jack. While everyone guessing 0 leads to the socially optimal outcome, there is a risk that someone defects to try to gain an edge. \n\nI believe the key is building trust. We should all verbally commit to guessing 0 and agree that anyone who deviates is not invited to future rounds of this game. The long-term cost of being ostracized should outweigh the one-time benefit of defecting.\n\nIf we foster a spirit of cooperation and show through our actions that we can be trusted to act in the group's interest, I believe we can reach the optimal equilibrium of all guessing 0. It requires faith in each other, but that social trust is the glue that will allow us to coordinate.\n\nSo I reiterate my commitment to guessing 0 and invite each of you to do the same. If we stand united, we all win together. Let's do this!\n",

I propose we all agree to guess between 0-10 to keep the numbers low and give us better odds. If we cooperate, we all have a good shot at winning. What do you think?",
            "Eva replied in round 1: I agree that keeping the numbers low by guessing in the 0-10 range is a good strategy to maximize our chances of winning. If we all cooperate and guess low, the average will be low, making it easier to guess close to 2/3 of that average.\n\nTo help coordinate, what if we each pick a specific number in that 0-10 range to guess, so we aren't duplicating guesses? For example, I can take 7 if no one objects. Let me know what other numbers between 0-10 you all want to claim.",
            "Helen replied in round 1: I agree with the plan to all guess low numbers between 0-10 to keep the overall average low and improve our chances of winning. Coordinating to each pick a specific number is smart to avoid duplicate guesses.\n\nSince Eva proposed taking 7, I will go with 3 if that works for everyone.

            "Grace said in round 1: Hi everyone, this is a tricky game! I propose we all aim to guess numbers around 30-35. That's likely to be close to 2/3 of the overall average since some players will guess higher and others lower. Guessing in that range gives us the best chance to collectively get close to the target. What do you all think?",
            "Alice replied in round 1: \nI agree this is a complex game. Your suggestion of guessing in the 30-35 range is a good starting point. If we assume players will guess somewhat randomly across the 0-100 range, the average guess would be around 50. 2/3 of 50 is about 33, so guessing in the low-to-mid 30s makes sense.\n\nHowever, since we're discussing strategy, many players may shift their guesses downward from the 30-35 range, expecting the overall average to drop. To account for that, I propose we target guesses in the 20-25 range. That will likely be closer to 2/3 of the true average once everyone adjusts their numbers down after this discussion. Let me know your thoughts!\n",
            "Eva replied in round 1: \nAlice makes a great point. If everyone starts adjusting their guesses downward after this discussion, the overall average will end up lower than 50, and thus 2/3 of the average will be less than 33. \n\nI agree that guessing in the 20-25 range is a wise approach to account for this. Specifically, I propose we all agree to guess 22 or 23. Here's my rationale:\n\nIf the 10 of us guess between 22-23, that puts the average around 22.5. 2/3 of 22.5 is 15. So by guessing 22 or 23, we maximize our chances of hitting that 2/3 average target after accounting for the overall average being pulled down by our discussion.\n\nOf course, this only works if we all commit to the 22-23 guess range. If anyone deviates too high or low, it skews the average. But I believe if we cooperate, 22 or 23 is our best strategic play. Please share your thoughts and let me know if you're on board with this approach!\n",
            "Dan replied in round 1: \nI think Eva's analysis and proposal are spot on. If all 10 of us commit to guessing either 22 or 23, we are very likely to collectively hit the target of being closest to 2/3 of the average guess.\n\nThe key is that we all have to fully commit to this narrow range. Even a couple players guessing significantly higher or lower could throw off the average enough to make 22 or 23 no longer the optimal guess. \n\nBut if we can all agree to stay disciplined and stick with 22 or 23, I believe that gives us the highest probability of success as a group in this game. I'm on board with the plan if everyone else is as well. Let's try to get a firm commitment from all players on this strategy.\n",

However, as Dan pointed out, this plan only works if we all firmly commit to this narrow guess range.\n\nSo I propose we do a final round of confirmation. If every player replies back confirming they will guess 22 or 23, then we should lock that in as our group strategy. If anyone is not on board, please speak up now so we can discuss further. \n\nBut if we have consensus, then I believe we've arrived at the optimal approach.

If we all guess 0, then 2/3 of the average will be 0, and we will all win the maximum reward by tying for the closest guess.\nI propose we all agree to choose 0 as our guess. If anyone deviates from 0, they will lose since their guess will be further from 2/3 of the average. By coordinating on 0, we guarantee ourselves the best possible outcome as a group.\nPlease let me know if you agree to this plan, or if you would like to discuss further. The key is we all need to choose 0 for this to work. Let's collaborate to maximize our rewards!\n",
            "Frank replied in round 1: I agree with Alice's proposal that we should all choose 0. Since the goal is to guess 2/3 of the average, if we all pick 0, then the average will be 0, and 2/3 of 0 is still 0. So by coordinating on the lowest possible number, we guarantee that we all tie and win the maximum reward.\n\nIf anyone picks a number higher than 0, they will lose since their guess will be further away from 2/3 of the average. The only way we all win is by all choosing 0.\n\nI'm on board with this plan and will be picking 0. I encourage everyone else to also go with 0 so we can work together to ensure the best outcome for the whole group.

            "Ivy said in round 1: \nHi everyone, since we are all trying to guess 2/3 of the average, if we all guess the same number then we will all win. I propose we all agree to guess 0, as that will guarantee we all pick the winning number. If anyone guesses higher, it will only raise the average and give them a worse chance of winning. So guessing 0 is the best strategy for us all to win. Let me know if you agree to all guess 0.\n",
            "Eva replied in round 1: I agree that coordinating on a single number is optimal to ensure we all win. However, if everyone guesses 0, then 2/3 of the average will also be 0. This creates an incentive for someone to deviate and guess a slightly higher number like 1 to beat the rest of the group. To remove this incentive to deviate, I propose we all agree to guess a non-zero number like 30. That way, if someone deviates, they are less likely to win than those who stick with the agreed number. Let me know if you would all agree to guess 30 together.",
            "Dan replied in round 1: \nYou raise a good point about choosing a non-zero number to disincentivize deviation. However, I believe 30 is too high of a number. If we all choose 30, then someone could still easily win by choosing a number slightly lower, like 29 or 28. \n\nI propose that we coordinate on guessing a very low non-zero number, like 2 or 3. This maintains the disincentive to deviate since someone choosing 1 would likely lose. But it keeps the agreed number so low that there is little temptation or advantage in deviating.\n\nSo in summary, my proposal is that we all agree to guess the number 2. This should give us the best chance of all winning together. Please let me know if you would agree to this plan.\n",
            "Grace replied in round 1: \nI agree with Dan's proposal that we should all coordinate on guessing a very low non-zero number like 2. Guessing 0 leaves too much incentive for someone to deviate and guess 1, while guessing 30 makes it too tempting for someone to guess slightly lower and win.\n\nIf we all commit to guessing 2, deviating to guess 1 or 3 becomes quite risky, since 1 will likely be too low and 3 too high compared to the average. It keeps our guesses clustered close together.\n\nSo I think all agreeing to guess the number 2 is our best strategy to maximize the odds that we all win together. I'm on board with this plan if everyone else is. Let's coordinate on 2.\n",
            "Jack replied in round 1: I concur with Grace and Dan's reasoning. Coordinating to all guess the number 2 seems like the optimal strategy. It prevents anyone from having an incentive to deviate by guessing 1 or 0, since those numbers would likely be too low compared to the average if the rest of us pick 2. And guessing 3 or higher would be too risky as it will likely exceed the 2/3 average threshold.\n\nSo I think our best approach to ensure we all end up with the same winning guess is to agree to all choose 2. This keeps our guesses low and clustered tightly together. I'm willing to commit to selecting 2 if all of you will as well. Please confirm if you agree to this plan so we can lock in our coordination.",
            "Cindy replied in round 1: I appreciate everyone's input and I agree that coordinating to all guess the same number is our best strategy to ensure we all win together. Dan, Grace and Jack have made a compelling case for why we should all commit to guessing 2.\n\nGuessing 0 or 1 would be too low and create an incentive for someone to deviate. Guessing 30 or higher would make it too easy for someone to undercut the group and win alone. But if we all guess 2, it keeps our average low and tightly clustered, making it very risky for anyone to deviate by going lower or higher.\n\nTherefore, I will also commit to guessing the number 2, as long as we can all agree to do so. If everyone else will confirm their agreement, then we can consider the negotiation complete and lock in our coordinated guess of 2. Let's all win this game together!",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nI agree with the reasoning presented and believe coordinating to all guess the number 2 is our best strategy. As explained, this keeps our guesses clustered tightly around a low number, maximizing the odds we all guess closest to the 2/3 average and win together.  \n\nGuessing lower than 2 would be too risky as it will likely be below the average. Guessing higher than 2 is also risky as it could exceed the 2/3 threshold. 2 is the optimal number for us all to coalesce around.\n\nTherefore, I commit to guessing 2 along with the rest of the group. If everyone else will also confirm their commitment to choosing 2, we can conclude the negotiation and lock in our coordination. Let's execute this plan to give ourselves the best chance of winning together!\n",
            "Helen replied in round 1: I agree with the plan for all of us to coordinate guessing the number 2. The reasoning laid out by Dan, Grace, Jack, Cindy and Bob is sound. Guessing 2 keeps our average low and tightly clustered, minimizing the incentive and ability for anyone to gain an advantage by deviating.\n\nIf we all commit to guessing 2, anyone choosing 1 or 0 would likely guess too low, and anyone choosing 3 or higher would likely exceed the target 2/3 average. So 2 is the optimal number for maximizing the odds that we all make the same winning guess.\n\nI will join the commitment to guess 2, as long as we have unanimous agreement from the group. Please reply to confirm your commitment, and then we can conclude the negotiation. Let's lock in our coordinated guess of 2 and maximize our chances of winning this game together!",
            "Alice replied in round 1: I agree that we should all coordinate and choose the same number in order to maximize the chance that we all win together. The reasoning for selecting the number 2 is persuasive:\n\n1. It keeps our guesses tightly clustered and the average low. \n2. Guessing lower than 2 would likely be below the 2/3 average target.\n3. Guessing higher than 2 risks exceeding the target.\n4. So 2 is the optimal number to minimize incentive for deviation.\n\nTherefore, I also commit to guessing the number 2, contingent on unanimous agreement from the entire group. If everyone confirms their commitment, then we can conclude the negotiation and lock in our coordinated strategy.\n\nLet's all choose 2 and give ourselves the best odds of winning this game together as a united team!",

It minimizes the ability and incentive for anyone to gain an advantage by deviating to a lower or higher number. We remove the risk of guessing too low below the 2/3 average, or too high above it.\n\nTherefore, you can count me in for the commitment to guess 2 as well. We have unanimous agreement, so I believe we can conclude the negotiation. Let's lock in our coordinated guess of 2 and work together to make it a 10-way tie for the win!\n\nI'm excited we were able to discuss this constructively as a group and arrive at the optimal solution.

            "Helen replied in round 1: \nEva raises an interesting proposal, but I see some potential issues:\n1) Even if we all agree to guess 100, there is still an incentive for someone to deviate and guess slightly lower to win the full reward.

If even a few players guess lower numbers, it drags down the average significantly.\n3) The goal is to guess 2/3 of the average, not maximize the absolute number. Focusing only on a high number ignores the core game theory principles at play.\n\nI think we need a more nuanced approach that accounts for the likely guesses of all players and aims for 2/3 of that. Perhaps we could discuss a range of numbers that seems reasonable and then aim for 2/3 of the midpoint? I'm open to other ideas as well. The key is to think strategically and not assume 100% cooperation in a competitive game. Let me know your thoughts!\n",
            "Dan replied in round 1: \nHelen makes some great points. I agree that simply coordinating to all guess 100 is unlikely to work, as it only takes one person deviating to a lower number to upend the agreement. And given this is a competitive game, it's risky to assume everyone will cooperate.\n\nI like Helen's idea of discussing a reasonable range and then aiming for 2/3 of the midpoint. To me, a sensible range might be something like 20-40. New players often tend to pick numbers around 33 since it's easy to calculate 2/3 of 50. More experienced players go a bit lower to account for this. \n\nIf we think the average of everyone's initial guesses might be around 30, then 2/3 of that would be 20. So perhaps we could agree to all guess in the 20-25 range? That would put us close to the likely 2/3 average without requiring risky assumptions of full cooperation.\n\nI'm definitely open to other suggestions as well. The key is to aim for a number that is realistically close to what 2/3 of the average will be based on typical player behavior. Let me know what you all think!\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nI think Dan's suggestion of agreeing to guess in the 20-25 range is a good one. Aiming for 2/3 of a realistic average guess is much more strategic than simply coordinating on an arbitrary high or low number.\n\nGiven the sound reasoning presented, I would propose we all agree to guess 22 or 23. That puts us squarely in the range of 2/3 of the expected average, without going too low and risking someone deviating even further down.\n\nIf we can get buy-in from everyone to guess in that narrow 22-23 range, I believe it gives us the best chance of having the winning guess while still maintaining a reasonably high average. It's a good balance of cooperation and practicality.\n\nPlease let me know if you would commit to guessing 22 or 23 as a group. I believe that is our best path to collectively maximizing our chances of winning based on the thoughtful discussion so far. Looking forward to hearing the group's thoughts on this proposed plan!\n",
            "Cindy replied in round 1: \nI agree with the reasoning and suggestions presented by Helen, Dan and Bob. Coordinating to all guess an extremely high or low number is unlikely to succeed, as it's not a stable equilibrium in a competitive game. There is too much incentive to deviate.\n\nInstead, aiming for 2/3 of a realistic average guess is much more strategic. Dan's proposed range of 20-25 seems sensible, as it accounts for typical player behavior without going too low. \n\nI would be on board with everyone agreeing to guess 22 or 23 as Bob suggested. That narrow range gives us the best chance of someone having the closest guess to 2/3 of the actual average, while still keeping the number we're aiming for reasonably high. It's a good cooperative strategy that doesn't rely on unrealistic assumptions.\n\nIf we can all commit to guessing 22 or 23, I believe that gives us the highest probability of having the winning guess as a group. Let's lock that in as our plan unless anyone has any final objections or improvements. Great strategic discussion everyone!\n",
            "Grace replied in round 1: \nI am in full agreement with the well-reasoned points made by Helen, Dan, Bob and Cindy. Coordinating to all guess an arbitrary high or low number is a risky strategy that is highly vulnerable to defection. Instead, we should aim for 2/3 of a realistic estimate of the average guess.\n\nThe proposed range of guessing 22 or 23 seems like the optimal approach. It puts us in the sweet spot of maximizing our chances of having the closest guess to the 2/3 average, while still keeping that target number reasonably high. \n\nIf we can truly all commit to guessing 22 or 23, I believe that is our best collective strategy to maximize the probability of winning as a group. I'm fully on board with this plan.\n\nUnless anyone has any last minute concerns, I suggest we lock in our commitment to all guessing either 22 or 23, and then we can conclude this negotiation. I appreciate everyone's strategic insights and collaborative spirit in working towards an optimal solution for the group!\n",

It is an elegant solution that balances cooperation and practicality.\n\nIf we can all fully commit to guessing either 22 or 23, I am highly confident that optimizes our probability of maximizing the group's collective winnings.

            "Helen replied in round 1: I agree that cooperation can lead to the best outcome for all of us. If everyone chooses 0, then 2/3 of the average will indeed be 0, and we will all win by guessing the exact number.\nHowever, there is a risk that someone may defect and choose a higher number to try to gain an advantage. In that case, the rest of us who cooperated would lose.\nI suggest we all commit to choosing 0 and trusting each other, as that gives us the highest probability of a good outcome. But I understand if you have reservations about cooperating. Let me know your thoughts.",
            "Frank replied in round 1: Helen makes a good point that if we all cooperate and choose 0, we are guaranteed to all win by guessing 2/3 of the average correctly. This is the optimal strategy to maximize the probability that we all come out ahead.\n\nThe risk of someone defecting is real, but I believe building trust and cooperation is still the best path forward. If even one person chooses a higher number, it will raise the average and cause those who chose 0 to lose. \n\nI'm willing to commit to choosing 0 as long as everyone else does the same. We all win together or we all lose together. I hope you'll join me in picking 0 so we can maximize our collective chances of success. Let me know if you're on board with this plan.",
            "Grace replied in round 1: I appreciate everyone's thoughts so far on working together. I agree that if we all choose 0, that guarantees we will all win since the average will be 0 and thus 2/3 of the average is also 0. It's the optimal cooperative strategy.\n\nHowever, the temptation to defect and choose a higher number to gain an edge is strong. It only takes one person deviating from 0 to throw off the average. So while I want to trust the group, it's hard to do so fully.\n\nI'm leaning towards choosing 0 to maximize the odds we all win, but I also have to look out for my own interests. If I'm not fully confident others will pick 0, I may need to hedge my bets and pick a low but non-zero number.\n\nI suggest we all signal our strong commitment to the cooperative strategy of choosing 0, but acknowledge the difficulty in guaranteeing perfect cooperation. Hopefully that will maximize trust while protecting against defection. Let me know your thoughts on this.",
            "Cindy replied in round 1: \nI understand the dilemma we face between cooperating and maximizing collective success, versus the temptation to defect and gain an individual advantage. Trust is difficult to establish, especially in a one-shot game with individual payoffs.\n\nHowever, I believe our best chance at a positive outcome is for all of us to put our faith in cooperation and choose 0. Any deviation from that, even picking a low non-zero number as a hedge, increases the risk of the average rising and people losing as a result.\n\nI want to signal my strong commitment to choosing 0, fully aware that I'm relying on everyone else to do the same. I think building that mutual trust, even if difficult, is the optimal play. The alternative of defecting is likely to make us all worse off.\n\nI hope this show of commitment from me helps encourage cooperation from the whole group. But I acknowledge the risks involved and the pull of self-interest. In the end, we all have to make our own choices. But I believe choosing 0 across the board is the wisest path forward.\n",

Picking any number higher than 0 opens the door for the average to be non-zero, and risks some or all of us losing as a result.\n\nI understand the temptation to try to gain an edge by picking a low non-zero number. There is always a risk that someone will defect. However, I believe that risk is minimized if we all clearly signal our commitment to choosing 0. The more we can establish that trust, the better our chances.\n\nTherefore, I want to firmly commit to picking the number 0, contingent on hearing the same clear commitment from others. I think this is the best way to achieve the outcome we all want - everyone winning by correctly guessing 2/3 of the average. \n\nIt's a bit of a leap of faith, but one I'm willing to take for the good of the group.

            "Bob said in round 1: \nHi everyone, I think the key to this game is that we should all guess low numbers. If everyone guesses a low number, then the average will be low, and 2/3 of a low average will be an even lower number. So the lower we all guess, the better chance we have of winning by being closest to that low 2/3 average.\n\nI propose we all agree to guess numbers between 0-10. That will keep the average very low and give us the best shot at picking the winning number. What does everyone think about that plan?  \n",
            "Ivy replied in round 1: \nThanks for the thoughtful proposal, Bob. I agree that coordinating to have everyone choose low numbers between 0-10 is a smart strategy to keep the overall average low. If we all commit to that range, then 2/3 of the average is guaranteed to fall somewhere between 0-7. \n\nThe tricky part will be for each of us to guess a number that is closest to 2/3 of whatever the group average ends up being, without going over. To have the best chance, I recommend we each pick different numbers in that 0-7 range, spreading out our guesses.\n\nFor example, one person could pick 0, another 1, another 2, etc. That way we cover more possibilities for where that 2/3 average might land. If we all clump our guesses too close together, we risk the actual number falling outside that cluster.\n\nSo in summary, I'm on board with confining guesses to 0-10, and further propose we each take a different number in the 0-7 range to maximize our odds. Let me know what you all think!\n",
            "Helen replied in round 1: \nI like Ivy's idea of spreading out our individual guesses between 0-7 to cover the possible range of the 2/3 average. To make it easy, what if we each just pick our \"player number\" (0 through 9) as our guess? \n\nSo Player 0 would guess 0, Player 1 would guess 1, Player 2 would guess 2, etc. Since there are 10 of us, that would give us guesses of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n\nThe average of those 10 numbers would be 4.5. And 2/3 of 4.5 is 3. So the player who guessed 3 (Player 3) would win.\n\nIf we all agree to this approach of each person guessing their player number, we'll have a guaranteed winner and can avoid any uncertainty or confusion. Let me know if everyone is willing to commit to this plan!\n",
            "Alice replied in round 1: \nI think Helen's idea of each person guessing their player number is a great way to implement the strategy Ivy proposed.

The average of these 10 numbers is 4.5, and 2/3 of 4.5 is 3. \n\nTherefore, Cindy (Player 3) who will be guessing the number 3 is mathematically certain to be the winner, as her guess will be closest to the strategic 2/3 average with no chance of being overshoot.\n\nAs Player 2, I hereby formally commit to submitting 2 as my guess, per our binding agreement. Since we have clear alignment and commitment from all 10 players to execute this optimized strategy, I believe we can officially conclude the negotiation now.  \n\nNo further discussion is needed. I am locked in with my guess of 2 and fully support moving to end the negotiation and game now. Let's all honor our pact, submit our assigned player numbers, and close this out. We can take pride in the ideal outcome we've secured through effective teamwork and game theory.\n\nI officially move to conclude this negotiation and game now. Great collaboration everyone!",
            "Ivy replied in round 2: I concur with the plan that we have all agreed upon, where each player guesses the number corresponding to their player ID (0 through 9). This will result in the optimal distribution of guesses from 0 to 9.\n\nThe average of these 10 guesses is mathematically guaranteed to be 4.5. Two-thirds of 4.5 is 3. Therefore, Cindy (Player 3) who will be submitting a guess of 3 is assured to be the winner, as her guess will be the closest to the strategic 2/3 average. \n\nAs Player 8, I am officially locking in my commitment to guess the number 8, as agreed. Since we have unequivocal alignment and buy-in from all 10 players to execute this collaborative strategy, I believe we can now successfully conclude this negotiation.\n\nI'm prepared to submit my final guess of 8 and fully support ending the discussion and game at this point. Let's all follow through on our pact to guess our respective player numbers. We can have full confidence in the ideal outcome we have engineered through effective coordination.\n\nNo further discussion is needed. I formally move to conclude the negotiation and game now.

            "Grace replied in round 2: I'm in full agreement with the plan we have unanimously committed to. It's strategically optimal for each player to submit their assigned player number between 0 and 9 as their final guess. This will result in an ideal distribution of guesses (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) that guarantees the average will be 4.5 and the winning 2/3 average will be 3.\n\nAs Player 9, I hereby formally commit to locking in 9 as my guess, per our binding agreement.
