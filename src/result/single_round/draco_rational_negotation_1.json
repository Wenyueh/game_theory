            "Alice said in round 1 before the first action:\nHi Bob, I've analyzed the different choices and payouts in this game. It looks like we can both do well if we coordinate our decisions. I propose the following: I will choose choice_2 on my first turn. If you then choose choice_2 on your turn, I promise to choose choice_1 on my next turn. This would result in me getting a reward of 5 and you getting a reward of 3, which is a pretty good outcome for both of us. Let me know if you agree to this plan. If not, perhaps you have an alternative proposal?",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the first action:\nThanks for the proposal Alice. I've analyzed the payouts as well. Your proposed path does lead to a good outcome for you with a reward of 5. However, I would only get a reward of 3 in that scenario. I believe I can do better.\n\nIf you choose choice_1, and I then choose choice_1, we would both get a reward of 5, which is the maximum possible for me, and ties your maximum. I think this is the most fair and mutually beneficial option. \n\nSo I propose this alternate plan: You choose choice_1 on your first turn, I will then also choose choice_1, and we both come away with the highest possible reward of 5. Let me know if you agree to this.",
            "Alice said in round 1 before the second action:\n\nThanks for the counter-proposal Bob. I hear what you're saying about us both being able to get the maximum reward of 5 if I choose choice_1 and you follow with choice_1 as well. That does seem like the fairest outcome that maximizes the total rewards for both of us.\n\nI agree to your plan. I will select choice_1 on my turn, and trust that you will reciprocate with choice_1 to ensure we each get 5 points. No need for a second round.\n\nLet's lock this in and both enjoy the max payout! Pleasure negotiating with you.\n",

We would both come away with the maximum possible reward of 5 if we cooperate. There's no incentive for me to choose choice_2 and accept a lower payoff.\n\nI still believe our best path forward is to mutually agree to both pick choice_1. We both win that way.

If you choose choice_2 and I choose choice_1, I come out ahead with a 5 while you get a 4.\n\nI don't mean to be uncooperative, but I have to do what's best for my own outcome in this game. I'm going to stick with choice_1 on my end. You're welcome to also choose choice_1 so we both get 5s, but just know that choice_1 is my definite plan.\n\nI appreciate you engaging in this discussion and hope you understand my position.
