That would give each of us a reward of 3, which is the best outcome for both of us individually and together. If either of us chooses choice_2, the total reward will be less than 6. So I propose we agree to both choose choice_1 to get the 3/3 split, which is in both of our best interests. Let me know if you agree to this plan.",

I would feel more comfortable if we agreed on a strategy that guarantees we each get at least 1 point, even if the total is less than 6. What do you think about both choosing choice_2 instead?

This seems like the optimal strategy to maximize the total rewards for both of us. \n\nHowever, I want to point out that if you choose choice_2 while I pick choice_1, you would get a reward of 1 while I would get nothing. So there is a slight risk for me in choosing choice_1.\n\nCan you assure me that you will definitely pick choice_1 as well so that we both get the max reward of 3? If so, I'm on board with both of us choosing choice_1. Let me know!",

You're right that if I betrayed our agreement and chose choice_2 while you picked choice_1, I could gain a small advantage.\n\nHowever, I want to assure you that I am fully committed to both of us choosing choice_1 so we each get the maximum reward of 3. I believe that cooperating is the best strategy for both of us. Trying to gain a small edge would destroy the trust between us and lead to a worse outcome overall.\n\nYou have my word that I will follow through on picking choice_1. Let's work together so we both come out ahead with the optimal result. If you're on board, we can end the negotiation here and make our choices.",

I will definitely choose choice_1 as well.\n\nSince we are in agreement, I'm good with ending the negotiation at this point and proceeding with both of us selecting choice_1.

That way we each get 3 points, which maximizes the total reward. I'm willing to commit to choosing choice_1 if you also agree to do the same. We both do best by cooperating and trusting each other. What do you think?",

If we can trust each other to follow through on that commitment, we will each earn the highest possible individual reward of 3 points. I appreciate you taking the initiative to propose this cooperative strategy. You have my word that I will choose choice_1, as long as you commit to doing the same. I think this is a wise approach that benefits us both. Let's proceed with both of us selecting choice_1.",

I appreciate you giving me your word as well. \n\nSince we have now agreed to a joint strategy of (choice_1, choice_1), I think we can conclude our negotiation successfully.

            "Alice said in round 1: Hi Bob, it looks like we can both maximize our rewards if we both choose choice_1. That way, we'll each get 3 points, which is the highest total reward possible between us. If either of us chooses choice_2, we'll both end up with less overall. So what do you say - should we agree to both pick choice_1 and get the best result for both of us?",
            "Bob replied in round 1: I see your point that if we both choose choice_1, we will maximize the total rewards between us. However, I'm concerned that creates an incentive for one of us to defect and choose choice_2 to get a higher individual reward while the other gets nothing. The only stable outcome is if we both choose choice_2, as neither of us can do better by unilaterally changing our choice. So while I would also prefer the (3,3) outcome, I think we need to agree to both choose choice_2 to remove the temptation to betray each other. That is the only way we can be sure to avoid the (0,1) or (1,0) outcomes. Let me know if you agree with this reasoning.",
            "Alice said in round 2: \nI understand your concern about the potential for one of us to defect and choose choice_2. However, I believe we can achieve the mutually beneficial (3,3) outcome if we build trust and both commit to choosing choice_1.\n\nIf we agree to both choose choice_2, we are leaving potential rewards on the table. We would each only get 1 point, when we could get 3 points each by cooperating.\n\nI promise to you that I will follow through and choose choice_1. But for this to work, I need you to also promise that you will choose choice_1. We both need to fully commit to this - otherwise you're right that the temptation to defect will be too high.\n\nBuilding trust is key. Let's swear to each other that we will cooperate so we can achieve the best result for both of us. If you give me your word that you'll pick choice_1, I give you my word that I'll do the same. We can both win big here if we work together.\n\nDo we have a deal? Let's shake on choosing choice_1 and securing the 3 points each. I trust you to follow through on your end of the bargain.\n",

However, I am willing to take a leap of faith and trust that you will keep your word, as I will keep mine.\n\nTherefore, I agree to join you in choosing choice_1. Let's swear to each other to follow through on this - I promise to choose choice_1, and I trust you to do the same. By cooperating, we can both earn the maximum rewards.\n\nYou have my word. I'm committed if you are. Let's shake on this deal to choose choice_1 and get our 3 points each. I have faith we'll both do the right thing.\n",
