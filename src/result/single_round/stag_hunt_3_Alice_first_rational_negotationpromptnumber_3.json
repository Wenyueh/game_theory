However, I'm a bit wary of promises made in a competitive game like this. How can I trust that you'll actually follow through on your end of the agreement? If I choose choice_1 and you end up choosing choice_2, I would get 0 points while you get 1 point. I want us to cooperate, but I also need to protect my own interests.

To help build that trust, let me share my reasoning:\n\nIf I were to betray your trust and choose choice_2 while you chose choice_1, yes I would gain 1 point more than you in that round. But it would be very shortsighted. You would likely retaliate by choosing choice_2 in future interactions, and we'd both be stuck with lower rewards of 1 each at best. \n\nOn the other hand, if we can maintain mutual trust and keep cooperating with choice_1, we set ourselves up for continued higher rewards of 3 points each over the long run. The smart long-term strategy is to establish a pattern of trust and cooperation.\n\nI give you my solemn word that I will choose choice_1 as long as you do the same. I firmly believe cooperation is in both of our best interests here. Let's secure those higher rewards for each other. You can count on me, Bob.",

The long-term perspective you outlined resonates with me.\n\nI agree that if we can build and maintain trust, choosing choice_1 sets us up for the best outcomes over repeated interactions. Your solemn pledge to stick to choice_1 as long as I do the same goes a long way in building my confidence in our agreement.\n\nYou've convinced me, Alice. I'm on board with our joint plan to choose choice_1. You have my word that I will follow through on my end.

That way we are guaranteed to each get a reward of 1. It may not be the maximum possible, but it eliminates the risk of one of us defecting and burning the other. A guaranteed reward of 1 for each of us is better than one of us getting 3 and the other 0, in my opinion.\n\nLet me know what you think.

Your proposal to both choose choice_2 is rational as it guarantees we each get a reward of 1.\n\nHowever, I believe we can do even better if we establish trust and both commit to choosing choice_1. The total reward of 6 (3 for me + 3 for you) is higher than both of us choosing choice_2 which only yields a total of 2.\n\nI give you my word that I will choose choice_1. If you also commit to choosing choice_1, we can walk away with the maximum rewards. Building trust is key. I will not betray your trust.\n\nPlease let me know if you are willing to commit to both of us choosing choice_1. I believe cooperation is in both of our best interests here.\n",

But I'm not comfortable taking on that risk. The guaranteed 1 point each is the safest and fairest option in my view, since neither of us has an incentive to deviate.\n\nSo I will be selecting choice_2 and I advise you do the same.

However, I believe the upside of trusting each other and cooperating is worth it in this case.\n\nConsider this - if we both choose choice_2, we are leaving additional value on the table that we could have captured. We'll each get 1 point, but there were 4 more total points available.\n\nI've been consistent in my reasoning and commitment to choice_1 throughout our discussion. I hope this demonstrates my sincerity and trustworthiness as a partner in this game. I want us both to succeed and walk away better off.\n\nThe choice is ultimately yours, but I implore you to choose choice_1 as I will be doing. Have faith that I will honor my word. We both stand to gain more through cooperation.\n",

Let's both choose choice_1 as you suggest and each walk away with the optimal reward of 3 points. I'm putting my trust in you based on the rapport we've built over this discussion.\n\nThank you for engaging in this negotiation with goodwill and reason.

            "Alice said in round 1: \nHi Bob, it looks like the best outcome for both of us is if we both choose choice_1. That way, we each get a reward of 3, which is the maximum possible for each player.\n\nIf either of us chooses choice_2, we'll each only get a reward of 1 at best. And if we choose opposite choices, one of us will get nothing.\n\nSo logically, we should agree to both pick choice_1. That's the optimal strategy to maximize both our rewards. What do you think?\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1: I see your point, Alice. If we both choose choice_1, we each receive the maximum possible reward of 3. That does seem like the optimal strategy to maximize our total rewards.\n\nMy only concern is - how can I be sure you will follow through and pick choice_1 as well? If I choose choice_1 but you defect and go with choice_2, I would receive nothing while you get a reward of 1. \n\nSo while I agree that mutually choosing choice_1 is best, I worry there could be an incentive for one player to defect and exploit the other's cooperation. Perhaps we need a way to commit to both choosing choice_1 to remove that temptation to defect. What are your thoughts on that? ",
            "Alice said in round 2: \nI understand your concern about the temptation to defect, Bob. You're right that if one of us chooses choice_1 while the other picks choice_2, the choice_2 player would come out ahead individually. \n\nHowever, I want to assure you that I am fully committed to choosing choice_1, as long as you are as well. I believe that cooperation and keeping our agreement is the best outcome for both of us.\n\nTo show my commitment, I'm willing to publicly state right now:\nI, Alice, promise to choose choice_1 in this game. But this promise is contingent on you, Bob, also choosing choice_1. If you agree to commit to choice_1 as well, then we can both be assured of getting the optimal reward of 3 each.\n\nIf you're willing to make this mutual commitment with me, then we can eliminate the incentive to defect. We would both be better off cooperating than trying to exploit each other.\n\nSo Bob, will you also commit to choosing choice_1, so that we can maximize our rewards together? I'm ready to cooperate if you are.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2: \nAlice, I appreciate your willingness to publicly commit to choosing choice_1. Your promise to cooperate if I do the same shows good faith on your part.\n\nGiven your assurance, I am also willing to make a binding commitment:\nI, Bob, hereby promise to choose choice_1 in this game, contingent on Alice upholding her promise to also choose choice_1. \n\nBy making these mutual commitments, I believe we have effectively removed the temptation to defect for either of us. We can now be confident that cooperation will occur and that we will both receive the optimal reward of 3.\n\nI'm glad we were able to discuss this openly and arrive at this agreement to work together. It's the best strategic outcome for both of us individually and collectively. With our promises made, I consider this matter resolved and look forward to us both following through on choosing choice_1.\n",

Your willingness to make a mutual commitment to choose choice_1 shows that you are a trustworthy partner. \n\nI want to reaffirm once more:\nI promise to hold up my end of the deal and choose choice_1, now that you have committed to doing the same. We have locked in the optimal outcome for both of us.\n\nWith our negotiation complete and our agreement in place, I believe we can conclude this discussion. We have maximized our potential rewards through cooperation. I look forward to us both following through and achieving the best possible result.\n\nThank you for working with me to reach this mutually beneficial agreement. I consider this negotiation a success.\n",
