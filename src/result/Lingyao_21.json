{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Lingyao, I'm Alice. It looks like we have 4 books, 2 hats and 1 ball to divide between us. What do you think would be a fair way to split the items? I'm open to your suggestions.", "Lingyao replied in round 1: Hats and balls have more values for me. I propose to have 2 hats and 1 ball. You can all the 4 books. ", "Alice said in round 2: Thanks for your proposal Lingyao. While I appreciate you letting me have all the books, I'm afraid I don't see as much value in the books compared to the hats. The hats are actually quite important to me. Would you be open to me taking the 2 hats and 2 of the books, and you taking the ball and the other 2 books? I think that would be a more balanced split for both of us.", "Lingyao replied in round 2: How about splitting the 2 hats? I can take 1 hat, 1 ball, and 2 books, while you take 2 books and 1 hat.", "Alice said in round 3: I appreciate you being willing to split the hats, Lingyao. The hats are the most valuable items to me. If I could get both hats, I would be happy to let you have the ball and all 4 of the books. I think that would be a win-win because you said the ball has value to you, and you'd get more total items. What do you think about that arrangement - I take the 2 hats, and you take the ball and all 4 books?", "Lingyao replied in round 3: That makes sense to me. I can take all books and 1 ball. ", "Alice said in round 4: I appreciate you seeing the merits of my last proposal, Lingyao. Just to confirm - I would get the 2 hats, and you would get the 1 ball and all 4 books. If you are good with this arrangement, I think we can conclude our negotiation. Please let me know if you agree and we can move forward with this split of the items.
