{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Lingyao, it looks like there are 1 book, 3 hats, and 2 balls available for us to divide. The books are worth 0 points to me, the hats are worth 2 points each, and the balls are worth 2 points each. \nI propose that I take all 3 hats and 1 ball, for a total of 8 points. You can have the 1 book and 1 ball, for a total of 2 points. This seems like a fair and envy-free split given the different item values.\nLet me know what you think of this proposal and if you have any other suggestions. I'm open to discussion to find a deal that works well for both of us.", "Lingyao replied in round 1: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [0, 0, 0], "bob_deal": [1, 0, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 0, "alice_score": 0, "bob_score": 9, "pareto": false, "envy_free": false, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
