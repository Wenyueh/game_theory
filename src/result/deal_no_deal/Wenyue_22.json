{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Wenyue, it's great to negotiate with you. I know there are 3 books, 1 hat, and 1 ball available. The books and ball are the most valuable items to me. How about I take the 3 books and the ball, and you can have the hat? I think that would be a fair split. Let me know what you think.", "Wenyue replied in round 1: This is unfair. You have 4 items while I only have one. What about we do the reverse, I have the ball and 1 hat and 1 book, and you can haev 2 books? Thus I will have 3 items and you have two. Since books are very valuable to me, value wise we should be fair", "Alice said in round 2: I appreciate you sharing your perspective. However, taking the ball and 1 hat and 1 book would leave me with little value, as the books are less important to me compared to the ball. What if I took the ball and 2 books, and you took 1 book and the hat? That way we each get 3 items, and the distribution should be more balanced value-wise for both of us. I'm happy to keep discussing to find an agreement that works well for us both.", "Wenyue replied in round 2: No I must have the ball", "Alice said in round 3: I understand the ball is important to you. It's quite valuable to me as well. Since we both want the ball, what if we look for a more even split of the other items? I could take the ball and 1 book (2 items total), and you could have the hat and 2 books (3 items total). I believe that would be a fair compromise where we each get some of what we want most. Let me know your thoughts on this proposal.", "Wenyue replied in round 3: No I must have the ball. What about I take the ball and 1 book, you take the hat and 2 books?", "Alice said in round 4: \nI appreciate you working with me to find a solution, but I don't think I can agree to that split. The ball has significantly more value to me than the other items. Giving you the ball and a book would leave me with much lower value overall, even though I would have more items. \nSince we both place high importance on the ball, perhaps the most fair solution is for one of us to take only the ball, and the other person gets all the remaining items. Would you be open to me taking just the ball, and you getting the hat and all 3 books? I believe that would make the distribution of value most even between us.\nLet me know if you would consider that, or if you have any other ideas for a split that is balanced and accounts for what we each value most. I'm confident we can find an agreement that works for both of us.\n", "Wenyue replied in round 4: no I cannot agree. The ball is very valuable to me as wel. ", "Alice said in round 5: \nWenyue, I completely understand the ball is very valuable to you, just as it is to me. We seem to be at an impasse since we both want it so much.\n\nSince neither of us wants to give up the ball, I think the only truly fair solution is to remove it from the negotiation. What if we split the remaining items - I'll take 2 books, and you take the other book and the hat? \n\nThat way, we each get 2 items and the distribution is even, without either of us feeling we lost out on the ball. If you agree, I think this is the best compromise to maximize value for both of us, given our shared priority on the ball.\n\nLet me know if you would be willing to split the items this way, without either of us getting the ball. I appreciate you working with me on this, and I'm hopeful we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.\n", "Wenyue replied in round 5: To maximize the values, someone should take the ball even though it is not the fairest. But we need to maximize the values we obtain. Okay my last proposal, I take the ball and you take the rest.", "Alice said in round 6: Wenyue, I appreciate your willingness to find a solution that maximizes the total value, even though it may not feel perfectly balanced. Your proposal is very generous, as you would be taking just 1 item while I get 4.\n\nHowever, given how important the ball is to me, I would be willing to make a similar offer in reverse. What if I take only the ball, and you get everything else - the hat and all 3 books? That way you'll have 4 items to my 1, which I believe more than makes up for me getting the high-value ball.\n\nI really think this is the best way for us to collectively get the most value out of the items, based on our shared understanding of the ball's importance. \n\nIf you agree to this - I get the ball, you get the rest - I'm happy to confirm that as our final deal. If not, I'm still willing to take my previous offer of removing the ball and us each taking 2 of the other items.\n\nLet me know what you think. I've aimed to be fair and I hope you feel the same. If you accept either option, I believe we can maximize our value while maintaining a good relationship. I look forward to your response.", "Wenyue replied in round 6: okay", "Alice said in round 7: Great, thanks for agreeing Wenyue. To confirm, I will take only the ball, and you will get the hat and all 3 books. I believe this agreement maximizes the total value for both of us, while still maintaining fairness given how much we each prioritized the ball.\n\nI'm glad we were able to have an open and productive negotiation to find a mutually beneficial solution. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you. Let's halt the negotiation here and move forward with this plan.\n\nhalt negotiation", "Wenyue replied in round 7: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [0, 0, 1], "bob_deal": [3, 1, 0], "total_negotiation_round": 6, "alice_score": 3, "bob_score": 4, "pareto": false, "envy_free": false, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
