{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Lingyao, to start our negotiation, I propose that I take 1 book and 2 hats, and you take the other book, the remaining hat, and both of the balls. How does this split sound to you? I'm open to discussing further to find an allocation we both think is fair.", "Lingyao replied in round 1:  hope to take 3 hats and 2 balls as 1 hat means 1 point and 1 ball means 1 point. 1 book means 3, but I would like you to take it. ", "Alice said in round 2: Thanks for your counteroffer Lingyao. I understand you'd like to take all the hats and balls, which would give you 5 points. However, the books are actually worth more points to me (2 points each) compared to the hats (also 2 points each). So your offer would leave me with only 2 points from 1 book. \n\nI'd like to propose a compromise - what if I take both books and 1 hat, and you take the other 2 hats and both balls? This way I would get 6 points and you would get 4 points, which seems more balanced. Let me know what you think.", "Lingyao replied in round 2: But in this proposal, I will lose the game. so please let me have 3 hats and 2 balls. ", "Alice said in round 3: \nI see your point about wanting to get enough items to win the game. However, giving you all 3 hats and both balls would leave me with only the 2 books, which are worth just 4 points to me. That allocation heavily favors you.\n\nI want us both to feel the outcome is fair and balanced. What if we split the hats, so you get 2 hats and I get 1 hat? Along with the 2 books for me and the 2 balls for you, I would have 6 points and you would have 4 points. \n\nI think this is the most equal compromise - we each get one category of items that is valuable to us. Let me know if you can agree to this, I'm willing to go with it if you are.\n", "Lingyao replied in round 3: I don't know if books only means 2 for you. I am truly honesty. Your proposal heavily favors you, and I will lose. I hope to have 3 hats and 2 balls", "Alice said in round 4: \nLingyao, I promise that I am being fully truthful about the books being worth 2 points each to me, just like the hats. I would not deceive you.\n\nI hear that you feel my last proposal favors me too heavily. I want to find an allocation we both feel good about. The issue is, if I let you have all 3 hats and both balls as you request, that only leaves me with the 2 books, worth just 4 points. Whereas you would get 5 points. So your proposal actually favors you more heavily.\n\nI still believe the most balanced split is for me to take the 2 books and 1 hat (6 points) and you take the other 2 hats and 2 balls (4 points). We each get our most valued category - books for me and hats for you. And the point totals are as close to equal as possible.\n\nIf you can't agree to that, then I propose we simply split everything evenly - 1 book, 1 hat, and 1 ball each. That way we each get 3 points. Let me know if either of these options work for you. I want us both to be satisfied with the outcome.\n", "Lingyao replied in round 4: You get 4 points, while I get 5 points, which seems a very fair allocation. In your proposal, you will get 6, but I only get 4, which is unbalanced. ", "Alice said in round 5: \nLingyao, I apologize, but I don't feel comfortable agreeing to an allocation where you get 5 points and I only get 4, especially when the items you want (the hats and balls) are not as valuable to me. \n\nAs I explained, the books are worth 2 points each to me, the same as the hats. So by taking all the hats and balls, you would get your most valued items, while I would be left with my less preferred item. That does not feel like a balanced outcome.\n\nI have offered two compromises:\n1) I take the 2 books and 1 hat (6 points), you take 2 hats and 2 balls (4 points) \n2) We each take 1 of every item (3 points each)\n\nBoth of these allocations are more equal than what you proposed. I urge you to please accept one of them so we can end this negotiation on a positive note where we both benefit. If not, then unfortunately we will have to end at an impasse and both walk away with nothing. I don't want that, so I hope you will work with me here. Let me know your thoughts.\n", "Lingyao replied in round 5: Why not you get 4 points, and I get 5 points? Your first proposal seems much more unfair, right?", "Alice said in round 6: \nLingyao, I understand you feel my getting 6 points to your 4 is unfair. But you getting 5 points to my 4 is also unbalanced, especially since you would be getting your most valued items (hats and balls) while I get my less preferred books. The books and hats are equivalent in value to me.\n\nI've offered two compromise options that are as close to equal as possible given the values and makeup of the items:\n\n1. I get 2 books and 1 hat (6 points), you get 2 hats and 2 balls (4 points)  \n2. We each get 1 book, 1 hat, and 1 ball (3 points each)\n\nI don't feel it's right for you to get 5 points to my 4 when option 2 gets us equal points. And option 1 at least ensures we each get our preferred item.\n\nI urge you to accept one of these two fair compromises. If not, then sadly neither of us will get any points. I hope you understand my position and are willing to work with me to find a balanced agreement. Let me know what you decide.\n", "Lingyao replied in round 6: Okay, I will follow your first proposal to take 2 hats and 2 balls", "Alice said in round 7: halt negotiation", "Lingyao replied in round 7: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [2, 1, 0], "bob_deal": [0, 2, 2], "total_negotiation_round": 6, "alice_score": 6, "bob_score": 8, "pareto": true, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": true}
