{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Isaac, to start off, I propose that I take the hat and you take the book and 3 balls. How does that sound to you? Also, I'm curious what value you put on each of the items?", "Isaac replied in round 1: Hey Alice. The hat is very expensive for me and I want to send all the 3 balls in exchange for that. How do you like it?", "Alice said in round 2: \nI appreciate you sharing your perspective. The hat is the most valuable single item to me. However, your proposal of me taking just the hat while you take everything else would leave me with 6 points total, while you'd get 7 total (assuming the book and balls have some value to you). \nI'd like us both to get a fair share. What if I take the hat and 1 ball, and you take the book and 2 balls? That way we each get items totaling 7 points in my value system, which seems more equitable. Let me know what you think of that idea.\n", "Isaac replied in round 2: The hat is really important to me. Which of my item do you want the best?", "Alice said in round 3: \nIt sounds like the hat is the key item for both of us. You mentioned it being very expensive for you. For me, the hat is worth 6 points, while the book and each ball is only worth 1 point.\n\nIf the hat is a must-have for you, I would be willing to let you have it. But in exchange, I would need to take all the remaining items - the book and all 3 balls. That way, you get the high-value hat that is important to you, and I get a larger quantity of the lower-value items, which add up to 4 points for me. \n\nI think this could be a reasonable compromise where we each get something of importance to us. What do you think - would you accept the hat and let me have the book and 3 balls?\n", "Isaac replied in round 3: It seems the price I pay is too expensive. What about I keep the book and give all hats to you?", "Alice said in round 4: \nI appreciate your willingness to give me all the hats, but remember there is only 1 hat in total. Giving me the 1 hat and you keeping just the book would leave the 3 balls unallocated.\n\nHow about this - you keep the 1 book and 1 ball, and I'll take the 1 hat and 2 balls. That way:\n- You get the book (1 point to me) and 1 ball (1 point to me) for a total of 2 points in my value system\n- I get the valuable hat (6 points to me) and 2 balls (2 points to me) for a total of 8 points in my value system\n\nThis seems like a fair distribution that gives you the book you want and me the hat I want, while splitting the balls. It's not a fully equal split, but I think it's reasonable given the hat is much more valuable to both of us.\n\nLet me know if you would agree to this allocation. I believe it's a good compromise for us both.\n", "Isaac replied in round 4: I can give you further the remaining ball. Please give me the hat.", "Alice said in round 5: \nIsaac, I hear that the hat is really important to you and you are willing to give me all 3 balls plus the book in order to have the hat. \n\nHowever, this arrangement heavily favors me, as I would get items totaling 10 points in my value system (6 for the hat, 1 for the book, 3 for the balls) while you would get 0 points.\n\nI want us to reach an agreement that feels reasonably fair to both of us. The hat is the most valuable item to me at 6 points. If I let you have the hat, I would need the majority of the other items to feel the distribution is equitable.\n\nI propose this allocation:\n- You get: The 1 hat\n- I get: The 1 book and all 3 balls \n\nThis way, you get the hat that is most important to you. And I get a total of 4 points from the book and balls. While not an equal split, I believe this is a fair compromise given the hat is significantly more valuable than the other items.\n\nPlease let me know if you would accept this proposal. I think it balances both our interests as best possible.\n", "Isaac replied in round 5: I should get the book", "Alice said in round 6: \nI understand the book has value to you as well. Let's see if we can find an agreeable split here.\n\nYou have proposed that you get the 1 hat and 1 book, while I get the 3 balls. \nFrom my perspective, this allocation would give you my 2 highest value items (the 6 point hat and 1 point book), while I would only get the 3 balls worth 1 point each, for a total of 3 points.\n\nI want us both to feel satisfied with the outcome. Since the hat is the key item for both of us, I propose this:\n\nYou get: \n- The 1 hat\n- 1 of the balls\n\nI get:\n- The 1 book \n- 2 of the balls\n\nThis way, you get the hat which is most valuable to both of us. I get the book, which is more valuable to you than to me. And we split the balls 1 for you and 2 for me.\n\nI believe this is the fairest possible allocation. You get your top priority item, the hat, plus 1 ball. And I get my 2nd priority item, the book, plus a larger share of the balls to make up for the value difference of the hat.\n\nPlease let me know if you would agree to this. I think it's our best chance at a win-win outcome.\n", "Isaac replied in round 6: I don't understand why you suddenly want to keep the book. Previously you told me that the hat is the most expensive one for you.", "Alice said in round 7: \nYou're right, I did say earlier that the hat is the most valuable single item to me at 6 points. That hasn't changed. The book and each ball are still only worth 1 point each to me.\n\nI suggested you keep the book in my last proposal because you had said \"I should get the book\", which made me think the book had more value to you beyond the 1 point it's worth to me. I was trying to find a compromise by letting you have the book since you seemed to want it.\n\nBut if the book is not that important to you, then I amend my proposal to this:\n\nYou get: \n- The 1 hat\n\nI get:\n- The 1 book\n- All 3 balls\n\nThis allocation gives you the hat, which we both agree is the most valuable item. And it gives me all the other items (book and 3 balls) to make up for not getting the valuable hat.\n\nI apologize for any confusion. Let me know if this distribution works for you. I do think it's the fairest solution given our value systems.\n", "Isaac replied in round 7: I cannot take the deal if the book belongs to you. Remember, you mentioned hat earlier but now it seems the book is also important for you. That makes me very confused and cannot know what you want. If that's the case, there will be no deal between us and we both get nothing. The solutions its , first, I should get the book, then let's talk about the others.", "Alice said in round 8: \nYou're right Isaac, I can see how my messages about the book have been confusing. That's my fault, I apologize. Let me clarify:\n\nThe book itself is not hugely important to me. It's only worth 1 point in my value system, the same as each ball. The hat is by far the most valuable item to me at 6 points.\n\nWhen I suggested giving you the book, it was because you had said \"I should get the book\", so I thought maybe the book was more valuable to you and I was trying to find a compromise. But the book itself is not a priority for me.\n\nYou've been very clear and consistent that you highly value the hat and also want the book. I want us to come to an agreement. So here is what I propose:\n\nYou get:\n- The 1 hat \n- The 1 book\n\nI get: \n- All 3 balls\n\nThis way, you get the two items you've said are most important to you - the valuable hat and the book you want. And I get the 3 balls.\n\nI believe this is the best, fairest allocation based on what we've both shared about what we want. I hope you'll find this acceptable so we can reach a deal. Let me know what you think.\n", "Isaac replied in round 8: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [0, 0, 3], "bob_deal": [1, 1, 0], "total_negotiation_round": 7, "alice_score": 3, "bob_score": 10, "pareto": true, "envy_free": false, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
