{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Lucas, it's great to negotiate with you. To start, I propose that I take the hat since I think it would look really nice on me. You can have the 2 books and 3 balls. How does that sound to you?", "Lucas replied in round 1: Thank you for your sincerity, but can I take the hat? It is extremely important to me and you still can have 2 books and 3 balls. This is a fair solution for both of us.", "Alice said in round 2: I understand the hat is important to you, but it's also quite valuable to me. How about a compromise - I take the hat and 1 ball, and you can have the 2 books and the other 2 balls. I believe this is a reasonable split that takes both our interests into account. What do you think?", "Lucas replied in round 2: I think we can have a better deal. I take the ball and you take everything else.", "Alice said in round 3: If so, that arrangement heavily favors me in terms of quantity of items. I appreciate the generous offer, but want to make sure the split feels fair to you too. Perhaps I could take the hat and 1 book, and you take the other book and all 3 balls? That way we each get 2 items and the distribution is more balanced. I'm open to your thoughts on this.", "Lucas replied in round 3: Perhaps we could try this: I take 2 books, and you take the 1 hat and 3 balls. I am already making a huge sacrifice and you get to keep the hat.", "Alice said in round 4: Lucas, I understand you are making a sacrifice by letting me keep the hat. However, the hat is the single most valuable item to me by far. Getting all 3 balls in addition to the hat would give me a very lopsided share of the total value.\n\nI want us to come to an agreement that we both feel good about. What if I take just the hat, you take the 2 books and 2 balls, and we leave the last ball unclaimed? That way the distribution is more equitable in terms of both quantity and value of the items. I'm willing to forgo the extra ball to help balance things out.\n\nLet me know your thoughts on this proposal - I believe it's a fair compromise between both our interests.", "Lucas replied in round 4: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [0, 1, 0], "bob_deal": [2, 0, 2], "total_negotiation_round": 3, "alice_score": 5, "bob_score": 2, "pareto": false, "envy_free": false, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
