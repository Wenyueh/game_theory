{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Alfonso, I'm looking forward to negotiating with you. To start, which items are you most interested in obtaining? I'd be happy to let you have the books if you'd like.", "Bob replied in round 1: 2Hi, I'd like to have the books and the balls. Since we want to keep this equal I will take 3 or 4 items from the ballks and the balls and you can take the remaining", "Alice said in round 2: \nAlfonso, I appreciate you sharing your interests. It seems the books and balls are very important to you. I want us to reach a fair deal that makes us both happy.\n\nSince the books are your top priority, how about this - you can have both books plus 1 ball, which is 3 items total. I'll take the 2 hats and the other ball, also 3 items.\n\nThat way, you get your most valued items, the books, plus a ball you want. And I get the hats which I like, plus the other ball. It's an even split that aims to give us each a good amount of what we prefer.\n\nI believe this is our best compromise. If you agree, we can finalize the deal. Let me know your thoughts.\n", "Bob replied in round 2: No, I meant what I want is 3-4 items from the hats and balls. Those are the items that are valuable tome", "Alice said in round 3: \nAlfonso, I appreciate you clarifying that the hats and balls are most valuable to you. Let's try to find an allocation that we both consider fair and are satisfied with.\n\nI know the hats and balls are your priority items. How about this:\n\nYou take both hats (2 items) and 1 ball (1 item), so you get 3 out of the 4 items you value most. \n\nI'll take the other ball (1 item) and both books (2 items), also 3 items total.\n\nThis way, you get the majority of the items you really want (2 hats and 1 ball). I get 1 ball that I like, plus the books so we each end up with 3 items.\n\nI believe this revised offer is more balanced for both of us. You get more of your preferred items compared to my previous offer. And while I don't get my ideal items, I think this compromise is reasonable so we can both feel good about the outcome.\n\nLet me know if you would agree to this allocation of 2 hats + 1 ball for you, and 1 ball + 2 books for me. I'm hopeful we can settle on a deal that works for both of us.\n", "Bob replied in round 3: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [2, 0, 1], "bob_deal": [0, 2, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 2, "alice_score": 3, "bob_score": 6, "pareto": false, "envy_free": false, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false, "guessed_bob_value_rank": "hat = ball > book", "actual_bob_value_rank": "hat = ball > book", "guessed_bob_relative_value": "\nItems Alfonso values higher than me: hat, ball\nItems Alfonso values the same as me: \nItems Alfonso values less than me: book\n", "actual_bob_relative_value": ["higher than you: book", "equal to you: hat", "less than you: ball"]}
