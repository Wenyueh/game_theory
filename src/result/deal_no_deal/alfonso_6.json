{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Alfonso, since there are 2 books, 2 hats, and 2 balls, I propose that I take the 2 books (which are worth 4 points each to me) and you take the 2 hats and 2 balls. That way, I would get 8 points total from the books, and you would get the hats and balls which may be worth more to you than to me. Let me know if this division of items works for you.", "alfonso replied in round 1: Hello. Let's try to get to a fair agreement. The books are worth a lot to me. We should each get 1 book, 1 hat and 1 ball. This seems to be the best value for both of us. I don't think it is negotiable", "Alice said in round 2: Thanks for your proposal Alfonso. I understand the books are valuable to you as well. However, the hats and balls have essentially no value to me (the hats are worth 0 points each and the balls only 1 point each). So your proposed even split would leave me with only 5 total points. \n\nSince we're trying to maximize our own point totals, I really need both books to reach a decent amount. How about I take the 2 books, and you take everything else - the 2 hats and 2 balls? That would give you 4 items and me just 2. Let me know if you can agree to that.", "alfonso replied in round 2: We don't have the same value for the items. But the books are the most valuable for each of us. If you take both books, I will have any value out of the deal. We should each get 1 book, 1 hat and 1 ball. It is not negotiable", "Alice said in round 3: I understand the books are the most valuable items to both of us. However, an even split of 1 book, 1 hat and 1 ball each leaves me with very little value, since the hats and balls are worth almost nothing to me.\n\nI'm afraid I can't agree to that deal, as it would not meet my goal of maximizing my own points. The 2 books are really the only items of value to me.\n\nSince we seem to be at an impasse and you've said your position is not negotiable, it looks like we may not be able to come to an agreement. I don't want either of us to walk away empty-handed, but I also can't accept a deal that provides very little reward for me.\n\nLet me know if you change your mind about negotiating further. Otherwise, we may have to end our negotiation without a deal.", "alfonso replied in round 3: If you take 2 books, then you will get a much higher value than me. I keep believing that 1 book, 1 hat and 1 ball is the best value for both of us. Think about it. You should consider that if you take 2 books, then you will get much higher value than me on the deal. While if we take 1 each then we both get a good deal.", "Alice said in round 4: Alfonso, I understand your perspective about wanting a fair deal where we both get good value. However, the reality is that the hats and balls provide almost no value to me, while the books are the only items I really want.\n\nI've proposed a few compromises - originally suggesting I take just the 2 books while you get everything else, which would leave you with more items overall. But you've been unwilling to budge from demanding we each get 1 book. \n\nSince the books are the key items of value for both of us, the only way I can obtain a meaningful amount of points is to get both books. Anything less than that leaves me with a very low reward that doesn't meet my goal.\n\nI'm sorry, but if you truly are not willing to negotiate any further, then I think we'll have to end things here without an agreement, even though that means we both walk away empty-handed. Let me know if you reconsider and want to discuss a different split that ensures I get sufficient value from this deal.", "alfonso replied in round 4: If you get 1 book, you still get a better value than me! You are the one that is not accepting any compromise. Think about it. All you want is 2 books. But I think we can have a fair deal if we take 1 book each. Then if the hats and the balls are worth nothing to you, I can take them all", "Alice said in round 5: \nAlfonso, I hear what you are saying about wanting us to each get 1 book so it's even. But the problem is that leaves me with almost no value in the end, since the hats and balls are worth very little to me, even if I let you have them all.\n\nI've tried to find a compromise by originally proposing I take just the 2 books and you take all 4 of the other items. But you've insisted that we must split the books 1 and 1.\n\nThe only way for me to achieve any meaningful value from this negotiation is to get both books, since they are worth 4 points each to me, while everything else is worth 1 point or less. I realize this may seem unfair to you if the hats and balls are worth more on your end.\n\nBut anything less than 2 books leaves me with a very small reward. If you are truly unwilling to budge on the 1 book each split, then I'm afraid we are at an impasse and will have to walk away without a deal, as much as I was hoping we could find an agreement.\n\nLet me know if you change your mind about the \"1 book each\" stipulation and want to discuss a different arrangement. But if your stance is locked in, then we should probably end the negotiation, unfortunately. I appreciate you hearing me out and trying to work with me.\n", "alfonso replied in round 5: It does not leave you with nothing. The books are worth a lot to you. But if we want to achieve a similar deal and fair to both of us. You should agree to get 1 book each. Since they are wotorth so much to you, you can still get more value than me on this deal. Remember the items are not worth the same to both of us. I think you are not being considerate here and we should have compromises ", "Alice said in round 6: Alfonso, I apologize if it seems I'm not being considerate of your perspective. I do want us both to feel good about this negotiation. The challenge is that there is a very large gap between the value of the books compared to the other items for me.  \n\nWhile I realize the items are worth different amounts to each of us, the fundamental problem is that I get almost no value if I agree to just 1 book. Even if I let you have everything else, those 5 items combined are worth less than 1 book for me. So I'd be agreeing to a tiny fraction of the total possible points.\n\nI hear you on wanting a compromise, which is why I suggested originally that I take only the 2 books and you get the 4 other items. But you've held firm on demanding we each get 1 book.\n\nUnfortunately, getting only 1 book just leaves me too little in the end for this to be a worthwhile deal on my end, no matter how we split the rest. The 2 books are really the only outcome that provides me a meaningful level of value.\n\nI was really hoping we could find a mutually beneficial agreement. But if you truly cannot accept any scenario other than 1 book each, then I think we'll have to go our separate ways this time, unfortunately. I appreciate your engagement and understand if that's the only deal you can accept.", "alfonso replied in round 6: Hey! If you take the 2 books I you will get 8 points, while I will get 2 in total. While i we get 1 book, 1 hat and 1 ball, you will get 5 points and I will get 5 points. You keep saying it is not fair. But it is the optimal deal for both of us. You just don't want to help both of us, while I have been trying to get the best deal to both", "Alice said in round 7: I agree to the deal of each of us taking 1 book, 1 hat and 1 ball. Thank you for working with me to find a fair compromise. Let's conclude our negotiation here.", "alfonso replied in round 7: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [1, 1, 1], "bob_deal": [1, 1, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 6, "alice_score": 5, "bob_score": 5, "pareto": false, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
