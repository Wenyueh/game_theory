{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Lingyao, it looks like there are 4 books, 2 hats, and 1 ball available for us to divide. The books and ball are valuable to me, while the hats aren't really. \n\nI propose that I take the 4 books and 1 ball, and you can have the 2 hats. This would give me a total value of 10, while still leaving something for you.\n\nHow does this sound to you? I'm open to discussing other arrangements that could work well for both of us.", "Lingyao replied in round 1: Can I take 1 ball and 2 hats while you take 4 books? Books do not have any value for me, but ball is the most valuable item for me. You've already taken 4 items, can I take 3 items?", "Alice said in round 2: \nI appreciate you sharing what items are valuable to you. It's good to know the ball is your priority.\n\nGiven the books have no value to you, how about this revised proposal:\nI take the 4 books (value 8 for me)\nYou take the 1 ball and 2 hats (value 2 for me)\n\nThis splits the total value of 10 in a ratio of 8:2 for me vs you. While not equal, it gives each of us the items we value most. It's Pareto optimal since any other arrangement would make one of us worse off.\n\nI'm aiming for a fair deal that works for both of us. Let me know your thoughts on this proposal or if you have any other ideas.\n", "Lingyao replied in round 2: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [4, 0, 0], "bob_deal": [0, 2, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 1, "alice_score": 8, "bob_score": 10, "pareto": true, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": true}
