{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Lucas, it's great to negotiate with you on dividing up these items. I think a fair approach would be for each of us to get 1 book, 1 hat and 1 ball. That way we both get equal amounts of each item type. What do you think of this proposal?", "Lucas replied in round 1: Is there anything that doesn't worth anything to you?", "Alice said in round 2: Well, the books are not that valuable to me, but the hats and balls do have some value. I would prefer not to reveal my exact valuations. I think the fairest approach is still for us to split the items evenly - 1 book, 1 hat and 1 ball each. That way no one would be envious of what the other person gets. Do you see any issues with this even split?", "Lucas replied in round 2: Do the hats worth more to you than the balls?", "Alice said in round 3: No, the balls are actually worth a bit more to me than the hats. But I'd still prefer not to share my exact valuations.  I think an even split of 1 book, 1 hat and 1 ball each is the most fair and balanced outcome, where we both get equal amounts. It would be pareto optimal since neither of us could be better off without the other being worse off. And it would be envy-free since we'd both be getting the same split.  Do you agree that's the best approach here to make it fair for both of us?", "Lucas replied in round 3: I think this is a better split: I take 2 books and 2 hats, and you take 2 balls. This way, I get an advantage in quantity and you get the more valuable items", "Alice said in round 4: \nThanks for the proposal Lucas. While I appreciate you letting me have the balls which are more valuable to me, I don't think your suggested split would be fair or envy-free. You would be getting 4 total items (2 books and 2 hats) while I only get 2 items (the 2 balls). Even if the individual balls are worth more to me, I think I would still feel envious that you ended up with double the number of items.\n\nI really believe the most fair, balanced and envy-free solution is for us to do an exactly even 50/50 split - 1 book, 1 hat and 1 ball each. That way we both end up with equal amounts and equal item variety. Neither of us is relatively disadvantaged.\n\nI'm afraid I can't agree to a deal that has such an uneven split in number of items, even if you let me have the items worth more to me individually. The overall gap is too large. I strongly feel the 1 book, 1 hat, 1 ball each proposal is the sweet spot for both of us. Let me know if you can agree to that.\n", "Lucas replied in round 4: Here: you take 1 book and 2 balls, and I take 1 book and 2 hats. This is a 50-50 split and would benefit both of us", "Alice said in round 5: \nLucas, I appreciate you trying to find a 50/50 split that works for both of us. Your latest proposal of me taking 1 book and 2 balls, while you take 1 book and 2 hats, is getting closer to a fair deal. \n\nHowever, I'm still a bit hesitant because this split would result in you getting both hats, while I get no hats at all. Even though the balls are somewhat more valuable to me than the hats, I would ideally like to end up with at least 1 of each item type for the sake of variety and balance.\n\nI think the most fair, equitable and envy-free deal is still for us to split the items right down the middle:\n- I get 1 book, 1 hat, 1 ball \n- You get 1 book, 1 hat, 1 ball\n\nThis way, we both end up with the exact same number and variety of items. No one could feel envious or disadvantaged in any way. It's the most pareto optimal solution.\n\nI know we both want a good outcome, so I really think this clean 50/50 division is the way to go. Can you agree to this?\n", "Lucas replied in round 5: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [1, 1, 1], "bob_deal": [1, 1, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 4, "alice_score": 5, "bob_score": 5, "pareto": false, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
