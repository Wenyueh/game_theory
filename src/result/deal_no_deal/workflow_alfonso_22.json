{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi alfonso, it's nice to meet you! To start off, I think it would be fair if we each take 1 book and 1 hat. As for the 1 remaining book and the ball, perhaps we can discuss how to split those. I'm open to your thoughts and suggestions. Let me know what you think would be a good distribution.", "Bob replied in round 1: There is only 1 hat, how do you wnat for each to take 1? I think it is fair that I take 1 item each: 1 book, 1 hat and 1 ball, while you can take the rest. What do you think?", "Alice said in round 2: You're right, I misspoke about the hats, my apologies. Since there are only 3 books, 1 hat and 1 ball total, your proposed split of you taking 1 of each item would leave me with just 2 books, which doesn't feel like an even split. \n\nI'd like to propose an alternative - what if I take 2 books and the ball (3 items total), and you take 1 book and the hat (2 items total)? That way we each get a variety of items and the quantities are a bit more balanced. Let me know your thoughts on this idea.", "Bob replied in round 2:  What if we change it a little, I take the 1 book or hat and 1 ball. This will  balance the fact that I end up with 2 items", "Alice said in round 3: \nAlfonso, I've been reflecting on our negotiation and I think I have a proposal that could work well for both of us.\n\nSince it seems the ball is very important to you, I propose that you take the ball and the hat. That way you get the item you value most highly, plus an additional item.\n\nI will take the 3 books in exchange. The books hold more value for me comparatively.\n\nThis way, we both get the items that matter most to us individually. And in terms of total items, I'll have 3 while you have 2, which keeps things relatively balanced.\n\nLet me know if you're willing to agree to this plan. I believe it's our best chance at a mutually beneficial outcome.\n", "Bob replied in round 3:  I agree ", "Alice said in round 4: Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement that works for both of us. To confirm, I will take the 3 books, and you will take the ball and the hat. Let's go ahead and halt the negotiation so we can move forward with this plan.
