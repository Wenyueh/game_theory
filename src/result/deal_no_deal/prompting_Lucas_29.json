{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Lucas, I'm looking forward to negotiating with you on how to divide the books, hats and balls between us. Since there are 2 books, 2 hats and 1 ball, I propose that I take the ball and 1 book, and you take the remaining 1 book and 2 hats. How does that sound to you?", "Lucas replied in round 1: does the hat worth more to you than the ball?", "Alice said in round 2: \nThe ball is actually worth much more to me than the hats. I really want the ball, but I'm happy to let you have both books if I can have the ball. The ball alone would be enough to make me satisfied with the division. How about I take the 1 ball, and you take the 2 books and 2 hats? I think that would be a fair split.\n", "Lucas replied in round 2: does the hat worth more to you than the book?", "Alice said in round 3: \nThe books and hats are actually worth about the same amount to me, which is much less than the ball. The ball is by far the most valuable item to me.\nSince the ball is so important to me, how about this proposal: I take the 1 ball, and you take all the books and hats, which is 2 of each. That way, you would get 4 items total while I only get 1, but I'm okay with that because the 1 ball alone would satisfy me. I think this is a fair deal that would make us both happy. What do you think?\n", "Lucas replied in round 3: Do the sum of 2 books and 2 hats worth more to you than the 1 ball?", "Alice said in round 4: \nNo, the 2 books and 2 hats together are actually worth much less to me than the 1 ball alone. The ball has a very high value to me, while the books and hats have relatively low value.\n\nSince the ball is so valuable to me, I would be happy to let you have all 4 of the other items (2 books + 2 hats) as long as I can have the 1 ball. I believe this would be a pareto optimal deal, because there is no other allocation that would make both of us better off - you would get more items than me, and I would get the one high-value item that matters most to me. \n\nIt would also be an envy-free deal from my perspective, because even though you would be getting more items, I would not envy your allocation since the ball alone is worth more to me than the rest of the items combined.\n\nSo to summarize, I propose that you take the 2 books and 2 hats (4 items total), and I take the 1 ball. I believe this is the fairest possible deal given our different values for the items. Let me know if you agree to this or have a different proposal in mind.\n", "Lucas replied in round 4: halt negotiation", "Alice said in round 1: halt negotiation", "Lucas replied in round 1: Sorry I mistyped. book=2 hat=2 ball=0 is a good deal for me"], "alice_deal": [0, 0, 1], "bob_deal": [2, 2, 0], "total_negotiation_round": 3, "alice_score": 8, "bob_score": 4, "pareto": true, "envy_free": false, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
