{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Lingyao, there are 3 books, 1 hat and 2 balls available. The balls are the most valuable items to me at 3 points each. I propose that I take the 2 balls and you can have the 3 books and 1 hat. That would give me 6 points worth of value and you 4 items. Let me know what you think!", "Lingyao replied in round 1: Both books and hats mean 0 to me. I propose 1. I take 2 balls; 2. I take 1 ball and 1 hat. ", "Alice said in round 2: \nI understand the balls are the only items of value to you. How about a compromise - I take 1 ball and you take the other ball plus the hat? That would give us each 1 ball (3 points of value to me, and the full value of the ball to you). The hat doesn't provide me any value but has some value to you.\n\nThis seems like a fair split where we each get half of the most valuable items. Let me know your thoughts on this proposal.\n", "Lingyao replied in round 2: So I will take 1 ball, 1 hat, and 3 books?", "Alice said in round 3: Yes, that's right. Under my proposed split, you would get:\n- 1 ball (the key valuable item for you)\n- The 1 hat \n- All 3 books\n\nAnd I would get:\n- 1 ball (3 points of value for me)\n\nThis way, we each get 1 of the 2 valuable balls. The hat and books provide some additional value for you even though they aren't valuable to me.\n\nI think this is a good compromise where we split the value fairly evenly. If you agree, let's confirm the deal and end the negotiation.
