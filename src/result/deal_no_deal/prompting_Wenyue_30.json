{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Wenyue, I'm excited to negotiate with you on dividing up these items. I think it's important that we come to a deal that we both feel good about. To start, I would propose that I take the hat and ball, and you can have the 3 books. How does that sound to you?", "Wenyue replied in round 1: Can I exchange 2 books with the 1 ball? Thus I will get 1 hat, 1 book, and 1 hat, and you take 2 books", "Alice said in round 2: Thanks for the counteroffer Wenyue. I appreciate you trying to find a mutually beneficial arrangement. The ball is actually quite valuable to me, so I'd prefer to keep it if possible. How about this alternative - I take the hat and ball, and you take all 3 books? That way we each get the items most valuable to us. Let me know what you think!", "Wenyue replied in round 2: Nope, only taking the 3 books are not equitable, as the ball is very valuable to me.", "Alice said in round 3: I understand the ball is valuable to you as well. In the interest of fairness, what if we split the difference - I take the hat, you take the ball and 2 books, and we leave the remaining book unclaimed? That way we each get one of the two valuable items (the hat for me and ball for you) plus you get some additional books. I believe this deal would make us both better off than not agreeing at all. Does this seem reasonable to you?", "Wenyue replied in round 3: We shouldn't leave the one book unclaimed as we want to maximize the total reward we obtain. If you don't want the book, let me take it. Thus I will take the ball and 3 books. YOu take 1 hat that is most valuable to you. Thus both of us will get what we want the most and we are leaving nothing behind and no waste", "Alice said in round 4: You make a compelling point about not wanting to leave any items unclaimed to maximize our total rewards. I agree we should split all the items between us if possible. \n\nHowever, taking just the hat while you get the ball and all 3 books doesn't feel like an equal split to me, even if the hat is my most preferred item. The hat is very valuable in my eyes.\n\nWhat if we do this instead - I take the hat and 1 book, and you take the ball and the other 2 books. That way, I get my most valuable item (the hat) plus 1 book, and you get your most valuable item (the ball) plus a majority of the books (2 out of 3). No items are left behind.\n\nI believe this is a fair compromise where we each get our most wanted item, divide the books, and waste nothing. Let me know your thoughts on this proposal and if you would accept this deal.", "Wenyue replied in round 4: sounds good, I will take the ball and 2 books. You will take 1 hat and 1 book.", "Alice said in round 5: halt negotiation", "Wenyue replied in round 5: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [1, 1, 0], "bob_deal": [2, 0, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 4, "alice_score": 9, "bob_score": 8, "pareto": false, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
