{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Lingyao, it's nice to negotiate with you. I think the fairest way to divide the items is for me to take the book and 2 of the hats, and for you to take the remaining 2 hats and the ball. This seems like an even 50/50 split of the total number of items. What do you think about this proposal?", "Lingyao replied in round 1: The hats have 0 value for me, so you can take all the hats, but I hope to take the book and ball.", "Alice said in round 2: \nThanks for your input Lingyao. I understand the hats may not have much value to you. However, the book is quite valuable to me - more so than the hats or ball. What if I took the book and 1 hat, and you took the other 3 hats and the ball? That way we each get 4 items total which is an equal 50/50 split, and you get the ball which you seem to value. I think this revised deal could work well for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!\n", "Lingyao replied in round 2: The book means 6 score for me, which is the most valuable thing for me. You can take all the hats. ", "Alice said in round 3: I understand the book is very valuable to you, Lingyao. However, it is also the most valuable item to me by far. The book alone is worth more points to me than all the other items combined. \n\nI want us to reach a fair deal, but giving you the book would mean I end up with much less total value than you. That wouldn't be an envy-free outcome for me.\n\nWhat if I took the book and 2 hats, and you took the ball and the other 2 hats? That way we each get 3 items. I know the hats have no value to you, but this seems like the most reasonable compromise. \n\nIf you really feel you need the book though, perhaps you could take the book and ball, and I'll take all 4 hats. That's the only way I could agree to you getting the book. Let me know what you think!", "Lingyao replied in round 3: If I give the book to you, then it is not a envy-free solution for me, as the books is the most valuable item to me. I can let you to take all the hats. ", "Alice said in round 4: \nLingyao, I understand the book is the most valuable item to you, just as it is for me. However, if you take both the book and the ball, that would leave me with only the 4 hats, which have little value to me compared to the book. This would not be an envy-free or fair solution from my perspective.  \n\nI've offered what I believe are reasonable compromises - either we each take 3 items including some hats which have no value to you, or you take the two most valuable items (book and ball) while I take all the hats. But you have declined both options.\n\nIt seems we are unable to find a deal that satisfies us both. Since neither of us wants to end up feeling the other person got more value, it may be best to halt negotiation at this point, as unfortunate as that is. Let me know if you have any other ideas, otherwise perhaps we should end the negotiation. I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this with me openly and honestly.\n", "Lingyao replied in round 4: I take your suggestion that I take the book and the ball, while you take all the hats. Does that make sense to you?", "Alice said in round 5: \nLingyao, I appreciate you considering my last suggestion. If you feel okay taking the book and ball while I take all 4 hats, then I am willing to agree to that deal. \n\nI know the book was the most valuable item to both of us, so I'm glad we could find a solution where you get the book since it means more to you, while I still get a larger number of items in return, even if the hats are less valuable to me.\n\nThis deal seems reasonably fair and envy-free to me given our different valuations and the total value each of us will end up with. Let's go ahead with you taking the book and ball, and me taking the 4 hats.\n\nThank you for the productive negotiation and for working with me to find a mutually acceptable compromise. I'm glad we were able to come to an agreement in the end.\n\nLet's halt negotiation.\n", "Lingyao replied in round 5: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [0, 4, 0], "bob_deal": [1, 0, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 4, "alice_score": 4, "bob_score": 10, "pareto": true, "envy_free": false, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
