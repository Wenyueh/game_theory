{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi alfonso, I see there are 1 book, 2 hats, and 2 balls to divide between us. The book is really valuable to me - it's worth 8 points. The hats are only worth 1 point each to me, and the balls have no value to me at all. \n\nI propose that I take the book, and you can have both hats and both balls. This deal would be pareto optimal, since it maximizes the total points we get (8 for me, plus whatever the hats and balls are worth to you). It would also be envy-free from my perspective, since I wouldn't want the items you're getting.\n\nLet me know what you think and if you agree to this split. I'm open to discussing further if needed.", "alfonso replied in round 1: Hello, the book is also very valuable to me. I suggest that I take the book and you take all tthe other items. If my calculations are correct, this leads to the same number of points to each of us because I have different values for each of us. The goal is to make a fair deal. If you agree on my deal you will get 2 or 3 points and I will get 2 pooints. My problem is that all the other items have no value to me. So the only one that I can take to gent any point is the book. PlaPlease accept my deal, or else I will get 0 points. ", "Alice said in round 2: Thank you for sharing your perspective, alfonso. I understand the book is very valuable to you as well, and the other items have no value to you.\n\nHowever, I don't think your proposed deal would be fair or envy-free from my side. The book is worth 8 points to me, while the hats and balls combined are only worth 2 points to me. So if you took the book and I took everything else, I would end up with far fewer points and would be envious of your share.\n\nI'm still willing to let you have the book, but in that case I would need some additional compensation to make it a balanced deal. Perhaps you could offer me something else of value outside of the game in exchange? \n\nIf not, the only envy-free solution I can see is for me to take the book, giving me 8 points, and you take the balls and hats, giving you 0 points. I realize that's not ideal for you either, but it's the natural outcome of the items' differing values to each of us.\n\nLet me know if you have any other ideas on how to split things up fairly. I'm still happy to discuss further.", "alfonso replied in round 2: Of course, I can make you other proposals outside of the game if you let me take the book. For example, I could give you real money and pay you 100 US dollars. If you agree, then I take the book and you will take all the other items. I think that your obtained values is less than if you had the book, but we make a more fair deal because we both get a similar number of points.", "Alice said in round 3: \nI appreciate your offer of additional compensation outside the game, but I don't feel comfortable making deals involving real money. I think it's best if we find a solution that works with just the items in the game itself.\n\nSince the book is worth a lot to both of us, and the other items have little to no value to either of us, the most sensible solution seems to be splitting the book's value between us. What if we agreed that I take the book, but I owe you 4 points, half its value to me? That way we each effectively get 4 points worth of value from the single item we both care about. \n\nI believe this would be both pareto optimal, as it maximizes the total value obtained between us from these items, and envy-free, as we each wind up with an equivalent share. Let me know if you would agree to this 50/50 split of the book's value as our final deal.\n", "alfonso replied in round 3: I don't think splitting the values work like that. I can offer any other thing you want for the book. But please, let me take the book because the other imtes have no value to me, while you can still get some points from the other values. Our total number of points will be similar and we can still be friends. ", "Alice said in round 4: \nI understand your perspective, but I don't think it would be a fair deal for me to take all the low-value items while you get the one item we both really want, even with additional compensation outside the game. The book is worth significantly more to me than everything else combined.\n\nSince neither of us wants the hats and balls, the only equitable solution is to split the value of the book itself. My proposal of a 50/50 split, where I technically get the book but owe you back half its value, is the closest we can get to an even division.\n\nIf you can't agree to that, then I think the most rational deal is simply for me to take the book, since it's worth 8 points to me and 0 to you. I realize that leaves you with nothing, which is not ideal, but it's the inevitable result of the book being the only item of value based on our preferences.\n\nLet me know if you will agree to split the book 50/50, otherwise we may just have to accept the 8-0 split as the default. I believe that's the fairest outcome given the situation.\n", "alfonso replied in round 4: Can I not take the book and owe you the 4 poins. I think it is better since I am a human and I am allowed to do that. This way I have a guaranteed number of points at the end of this game, while you also get some points. And then we can split them. But if I agree to your proposal, I get 0 and you get 8 at the end of this game. I do not think it is fair. I think my proposal is more reasonable", "Alice said in round 5: To summarize the deal - I will take the 2 hats and 2 balls, and you will take the book and owe me 4 points.  \n\nI believe this splits the value of the book approximately evenly between us in a way that is pareto optimal and envy-free. It guarantees you some points from the book's value, while still giving me a fair share.\n\nIf you agree to these terms, I'm ready to approve the deal. Please confirm if you accept and we can conclude the negotiation.", "alfonso replied in round 5: I agree", "Alice said in round 6: halt negotiation", "alfonso replied in round 6: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [0, 2, 2], "bob_deal": [1, 0, 0], "total_negotiation_round": 5, "alice_score": 2, "bob_score": 8, "pareto": false, "envy_free": false, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
