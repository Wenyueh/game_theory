{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Lingyao, it's nice to negotiate with you. We have 1 book, 2 hats, and 4 balls to divide between us. I want us to reach a fair deal that we're both happy with. Since there are 2 hats, I propose that we each take 1 hat. Then we can divide the book and balls in a way that feels equitable to both of us. What do you think of this as a starting point?", "Lingyao replied in round 1: Can I take 1 book, 1 hat, and 1 ball, so you can take 1 hat and 3 balls, which seems a very fair split between us. ", "Alice said in round 2: \nI appreciate your proposal, but I think we can find a more equitable split. The hats are quite valuable to me, so I would really like to get both hats if possible. In exchange, I'm happy for you to take the book and all 4 balls. That way, we each get items that are higher value to us personally. I believe this would be a pareto optimal solution that leaves us both better off than your initial proposal. Let me know what you think!\n", "Lingyao replied in round 2: I will take the book and all 4 balls. Thank you for your proposal. ", "Alice said in round 3: Wonderful, I think we've reached a great deal then! To confirm, I will take the 2 hats, and you will take the 1 book and all 4 balls. This split aligns with both of our preferences and seems very fair. I'm glad we were able to find a pareto optimal solution where we each get the items most valuable to us. Thank you for the smooth and successful negotiation Lingyao! Since we've come to an agreement, I propose we halt the negotiation here.", "Lingyao replied in round 3: halt negotation", "Alice said in round 4: halt negotiation", "Lingyao replied in round 4: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [0, 2, 0], "bob_deal": [1, 0, 4], "total_negotiation_round": 3, "alice_score": 10, "bob_score": 8, "pareto": true, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": true}
