{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Alfonso, it's nice to negotiate with you. I see there are 1 book, 3 hats, and 2 balls available. The balls are quite valuable to me at 4 points each, while the book is worth 2 points and the hats aren't worth anything to me. Perhaps I could take the 2 balls, and you could have the book and 3 hats? That way I would get 8 points worth of value. Let me know what you think and if you have any other proposals. I'm open to discussion to find an agreement that works well for both of us.", "alfonso replied in round 1: agreed", "Alice said in round 2: halt negotiation", "alfonso replied in round 2: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [0, 0, 2], "bob_deal": [1, 3, 0], "total_negotiation_round": 1, "alice_score": 8, "bob_score": 10, "pareto": true, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": true}
