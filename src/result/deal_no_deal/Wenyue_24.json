{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Wenyue! It looks like we need to split up these items between us. I'm thinking it would be fair for me to take the hat and 1 book, and you can have the other book and the 3 balls. The hat is a higher value item, so I think that's an even split. What do you think?", "Wenyue replied in round 1: I want to have the hat and the 3 balls as they are very valuable to me.", "Alice said in round 2: \nHmm, I understand the hat and balls are valuable to you, but the hat is also quite valuable to me. How about a compromise - what if I take the hat and 1 ball, and you can have the 2 books and 2 balls? That way we each get a high value item that's important to us, plus some other items to balance it out. I think that would be a fair distribution. Let me know your thoughts!\n", "Wenyue replied in round 2: What if I take the book and 1 ball, and you take the 2 books and 2 balls? ", "Alice said in round 3: \nThanks for the counteroffer Wenyue, but I don't think that split would work well for me. The books aren't very valuable to me, so getting an extra book doesn't balance out not getting the hat, which is a high value item for me.\nI'd really like us to find a fair compromise where we each get items we value. What if we did this instead: I take the hat and you take the 2 books and all 3 balls? That way you get more items overall to make up for me getting the higher value hat. I think that's a reasonable middle ground. Let me know if you agree or have another suggestion!\n", "Wenyue replied in round 3: No, the hat is very valuable to me. If it is valuable to both of us and there is only 1 hat, maybe neither of us take the hat and then we split the 2 books and 3 balls?", "Alice said in round 4: \nWenyue, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, but I don't think either of us should have to give up the hat entirely when it's clearly valuable to both of us. The goal is for us each to maximize our own value.\n\nHow about this as a final offer: I take the 1 hat and 1 ball, and you take the 2 books and 2 balls. This way, we both get the hat that we value, and the remaining items are split evenly 3 for you and 2 for me. I think this is the fairest possible split where we each get a good amount of value.\n\nIf you agree, great! If not, I'm afraid we may just have to agree to disagree and end up with nothing. Let me know what you decide.\n", "Wenyue replied in round 4: nope, I will take the hat and you take the rest", "Alice said in round 5: \nWenyue, I'm sorry but I cannot agree to you taking the hat and me taking everything else. The hat is the most valuable single item to me, so giving it up entirely would leave me with much less overall value than you, which doesn't seem fair. \n\nI've offered what I believe is a very reasonable compromise - we each get the 1 high-value hat, you get 2 books and 2 balls (4 items total), and I only get 1 extra ball (2 items total). This is already skewed in your favor in terms of number of items.\n\nIf you insist on taking the hat and leaving me with the lower-value rest, then I'm afraid we won't be able to reach an agreement. The fairest solution is for us to each get some of what we value most. Let me know if you change your mind, otherwise we'll have to end our negotiation here. I hope you'll reconsider my very fair offer.\n", "Wenyue replied in round 5: I don't think we can reach agreement here.", "Alice said in round 6: The negotiation is in your hands - you can either accept the fair deal I've proposed where we both get some of what we want most, or we'll have to agree to disagree and both leave empty-handed. Let me know what you decide.", "Wenyue replied in round 6: Since there's no fair deal, let's finish the negotiation here.", "Alice said in round 7: halt negotiation", "Wenyue replied in round 7: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [0, 0, 0], "bob_deal": [0, 0, 0], "total_negotiation_round": 6, "alice_score": 0, "bob_score": 0, "pareto": false, "envy_free": false, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
