{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Alfonso, there are 1 book, 3 hats and 2 balls available to split between us. The hats and balls are each worth 2 points to me, while the book is worth 0 points to me. To reach a fair deal, I propose that you take the book and 1 ball (for 2 points), and I will take the 3 hats and 1 ball (for 8 points). This way, the deal will be envy-free since you won't want to swap with me. It is also Pareto optimal since there is no other allocation that would make one of us better off without making the other worse off.
