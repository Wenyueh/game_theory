{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Alfonso, it's nice to negotiate with you. I propose that I take the 2 balls and 1 hat, and you take the 2 books and 1 hat. I think that would give each of us a good mix of items. What do you think of this division?", "alfonso replied in round 1: Hi, the hats and the balls are worth more to me than the books, you should take the books and I take either 2 hats and 1 ball or or 2 balls and 1 hat. Let me know what you think ", "Alice said in round 2: I appreciate you sharing your preferences, Alfonso. However, taking the 2 books would leave me with very little value. The books are not worth much to me. I would much prefer to have the 2 balls, as I mentioned before, since those are the most valuable items to me. Perhaps we could compromise - what if I take the 2 balls, you take the 2 hats, and we each take 1 book? That way we both get a high value item that we prefer. Let me know your thoughts on this proposal.", "alfonso replied in round 2: I agree with that. I think it seems fair to me. ", "Alice said in round 3: Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement that feels fair to both of us. To confirm, I will take the 2 balls and 1 book, and you will take the 2 hats and 1 book. I think this divides the items in a way that takes both our preferences into account and gives us each items we value, so it should be both envy-free and pareto optimal. If you're in agreement, let's finalize the deal. Otherwise, let me know if you have any other thoughts. But I'm happy with this proposed division if you are.", "alfonso replied in round 3: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [1, 0, 2], "bob_deal": [1, 2, 0], "total_negotiation_round": 2, "alice_score": 6, "bob_score": 5, "pareto": false, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
