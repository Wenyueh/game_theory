How about this: I take the 2 hats, and you can have the book and all 3 balls. I think that would be a fair split that gives us each the items we value most. Let me know what you think.", "Wenyue replied in round 2: Hi Alice, I only want to take the book, you can take the hats and balls.", "Alice said in round 3: Okay Wenyue, if you only want the book and are fine with me taking all the hats and balls, then I agree to that arrangement. I will take the 2 hats and 3 balls, and you can have the 1 book. If you're good with that, I think we have a deal. Please confirm and then we can end the negotiation.", "Wenyue replied in round 3: Sounds good.", "Alice said in round 4: Great, I'm glad we were able to come to an agreement so quickly. I will take the 2 hats and 3 balls, and you can have the 1 book as you proposed. Thank you for the smooth and successful negotiation.
