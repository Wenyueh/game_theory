{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Alfonso, I'd like to discuss how we can split up these items. The hat is the most valuable to me. I propose that I get the 1 hat and 1 ball, and you can have the book and the other 2 balls. That way we each get 3 items that are valuable to us. What do you think?", "Alfonso replied in round 1: Hi. I beleive this is the optimal split. Even if the hat is the most valuable to you, I  I think  you will get a better value if you take 3 balls, since the combined value will give you a higher total value. I will take the 1 book and 1 hat. In total you will get more number of items and you will get a better value", "Alice said in round 2: Thanks for your thoughts, Alfonso. I appreciate you trying to maximize my total value, but the hat is significantly more valuable to me than the balls. Even though I would get more items with the 3 balls, their total value to me is only 3, while the 1 hat alone is worth 6. So I would much prefer to have the 1 hat. If you take the book and 2 balls, we would each be getting items worth a total of 7 - a fair and even split. Let me know if you can agree to that.", "Alfonso replied in round 2: Okay, I will take the 1 book and you can take the 1 hat and 3 balls", "Alice said in round 3: Thanks Alfonso, but your suggested split doesn't work for me. The hat is worth significantly more to me than the balls - 6 points vs 1 point each. So while I appreciate you offering me more total items, I would much prefer having the 1 hat, even if it means fewer items overall.\n\nHow about this - I take the 1 hat, and you take the 1 book and all 3 balls. That way, we each get items totaling 6 points in value. It's the most equal split in terms of value for both of us. Let me know if you can agree to that and we can wrap up the negotiation.", "Alfonso replied in round 3: You can take the 3 balls too. They worth nothing to me. Althought I would like to take the hat too", "Alice said in round 4: That's very generous of you to offer me the 3 balls in addition to the hat. But if the balls are worth nothing to you, it doesn't really benefit you to give them to me. I want us to reach an agreement that feels fair and balanced for both of us.\n\nHow about this as a final proposal: I will take the 1 hat that is most valuable to me. You take the 1 book and all 3 balls. That way, you get a higher number of items (4 total), and items that have some value to you. While I only get 1 item, it's the item that is significantly more valuable to me than the others. \n\nI believe this is the fairest possible division for both of us. If you agree, let's finalize the deal. ", "Alfonso replied in round 4: I don't want the balls. I want the 1 book and 1 hat. You can take the 3 balls. Even if you don't get the item with the highest reward. You will still get a good value", "Alice said in round 5: Alfonso, I understand you want the hat, but giving me the 3 balls which have no value to you doesn't actually increase my reward. The hat alone is worth much more to me than all 3 balls combined.\n\nI've been more than fair in letting you have the book (your most valuable item) and offering you the balls as well. But I can't agree to a deal where I only get items worth 3 points and you get items worth 7 points - especially when the hat is so valuable to me. \n\nI must insist on getting the 1 hat for myself to make this equitable. You can have everything else - the book and all the balls. That's my final offer, take it or leave it.", "Alfonso replied in round 5: Take the balls too", "Alice said in round 6: Alfonso, I appreciate you offering me the balls, but they provide no additional value to me beyond the hat. Simply giving me more items doesn't make the deal more fair if those items are worthless to me.\n\nI've tried my best to reach an equitable agreement where we both get items valuable to us. My final offer stands - I get the 1 hat, you get the book and all 3 balls. That provides the most even split based on item values for each of us. \n\nIf you can't agree to that, then I'm afraid we won't be able to make a deal. Let me know if you'll accept my final offer, otherwise we'll have to end the negotiation. I hope you understand my position.", "Alfonso replied in round 6: Deal", "Alice said in round 7: Deal, I'm glad we could come to an agreement that works for both of us. I'll take the 1 hat, and you can have the 1 book and the 3 balls. Let's halt the negotiation here. Thanks for working with me on this, Alfonso!", "Alfonso replied in round 7: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [0, 1, 0], "bob_deal": [1, 0, 3], "total_negotiation_round": 6, "alice_score": 6, "bob_score": 8, "pareto": false, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
