{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Lingyao, it's nice to meet you and negotiate this split of items together. To start off, I'd like to propose that I take the 1 hat and 2 of the balls, and you can have the 2 books and the remaining 1 ball. I think this would be a fair 50/50 split of the total number of items. Let me know what you think of this proposal and if you have any other ideas.", "Lingyao replied in round 1: Can I take 1 hat and 1 book? Then you can take 3 balls and 1 book. I think this is a fair split between us. ", "Alice said in round 2: Thanks for your counter-proposal. While I appreciate you offering me the 3 balls and 1 book, the hat is actually the most valuable item to me. Getting the hat is my top priority. Would you be willing to let me have the 1 hat if I let you take all 3 balls in addition to the 1 book? That way you'd end up with more items overall. Let me know if this works for you.", "Lingyao replied in round 2:  I want to be quite honest. Only hat has value to me, while books and balls' values are very minimal. ", "Alice said in round 3: I understand the hat is very valuable to you. It is quite important to me as well. Since we both highly value the hat, perhaps we could look at some other creative ways to split the items that would be fair to both of us?\n\nWhat if I took the hat and just 1 ball, and you took the 3 books and the other 2 balls? That would give you a higher quantity of items overall. I'm trying my best to come up with an equitable split given both of our interests in the hat. Let me know your thoughts on this idea or if there are other options you'd like to explore.", "Lingyao replied in round 3: 1 hat means 10 point to me, so I have to take the 1 hat. Balls do not have any value for me. ", "Alice said in round 4: \nI see, so the hat is worth 10 points to you and is clearly your top priority, while the books and balls are of minimal value to you comparatively. \n\nI want to be transparent as well - the hat is also the most valuable item to me at 4 points. While not quite as high as 10 points, it's still very significant and more than the other items.\n\nGiven we both place the highest value on the single hat, I'm trying to find a fair compromise. What if you took the hat, and to make up for me not getting the hat, I took all the other items - the 2 books and 3 balls? \n\nThat way you get your top priority item, the hat, and I get a larger overall quantity to try to make up the value for me. I realize it's not a perfect solution, but I'm trying my best to find a split that addresses both our priorities to some degree.\n\nLet me know what you think. I'm open to discussing further if needed.\n", "Lingyao replied in round 4: It makes sense to me. I just take 1 hat, while you take all the rest. ", "Alice said in round 5: I'm glad we were able to come to an understanding and find a split that works for both of us given our different priorities. To confirm - you will take the 1 hat which you value the most at 10 points, and I will take the 2 books and all 3 balls.\n\nWhile the hat was my top choice as well, I understand it is even more valuable to you, so I'm willing to concede it in order to reach an agreement. The books and balls will allow me to gain some value, even if not as much as the hat alone.\n\nIf you are in agreement with this plan, I'm ready to conclude our negotiation. Please confirm and we can wrap things up. It was a pleasure working with you on this, Lingyao!", "Lingyao replied in round 5: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [2, 0, 3], "bob_deal": [0, 1, 0], "total_negotiation_round": 4, "alice_score": 6, "bob_score": 8, "pareto": false, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
