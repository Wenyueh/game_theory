{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Lingyao, based on the items available, I propose the following deal: I will take the 1 hat (worth 4 points to me) and 1 of the balls (worth 2 points). You can have the 2 books and the other ball. This would give me a total of 6 points and you a total of 5 points, assuming the books and balls are worth 1 point each to you. I believe this deal is fair and envy-free for both of us. Let me know what you think!", "Lingyao replied in round 1: 1 book worths 2, while 1 hat worths 6. Can I take 1 book and 1 hat while you take all the rest?", "Alice said in round 2: \nThanks for the offer Lingyao, but I don't think that deal would be fair for me. If you take 1 book (worth 2 to you) and the hat (worth 6 to you), that's a total of 8 points for you. Meanwhile I would get 1 book and 2 balls, which is only worth 5 points total to me. \nI want us to reach an envy-free deal where we both feel the division is fair. What if I take the 1 hat (4 points) and you take everything else - the 2 books (4 points) and 2 balls (2 points)? That way we each get 6 points worth of value. Let me know your thoughts on this proposal.\n", "Lingyao replied in round 2: But hat is the most valuable for me. You will have 3 items, while I will only have 1 book and 1 hat (2 items).", "Alice said in round 3: \nI understand the hat is very valuable to you. How about this alternative - what if you take 1 book (2 points), 1 ball (1 point) and the hat (6 points)? That would give you a total of 9 points. \n\nI would then take the other book (1 point for me) and ball (2 points), giving me a total of 3 points. While I would be getting fewer points, I'm okay with that because I know the hat is really important to you.\n\nThis way, you get your high value item (the hat) plus some other items, and the total number of items is more even - you'd have 3 and I'd have 2. Let me know if this proposal works better for you.\n", "Lingyao replied in round 3: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [0, 0, 0], "bob_deal": [1, 1, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 2, "alice_score": 0, "bob_score": 8, "pareto": false, "envy_free": false, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
