My goal is for us to come to an agreement that feels fair to both of us. How about this revised proposal - I will take the 2 books and 1 hat, which have a total value to me of 6. You can take the other 2 hats and the 2 balls. This way, we are splitting the hats evenly and I am still getting the books which are more valuable to me.
