{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi alfonso, thanks for negotiating with me. I propose that I take the 1 book, and you can have the 4 hats and 1 ball. How does that sound to you?", "Bob replied in round 1: Hello, I think I should take the 1 book and 1 ball, while you can takke all 4 hats", "Alice said in round 2: \nThanks for sharing your thoughts alfonso. I understand you are interested in the book and ball. The book in particular is quite meaningful to me.\n\nWhat if we split the items this way:\n- I take the 1 book and all 4 hats \n- You take the 1 ball\n\nI believe this division takes both our interests into account. You get the ball which seems important to you. And I get to keep the book I value highly, plus the hats.\n\nLet me know if you would be agreeable to this arrangement. I'm open to discussing further to find a solution we both feel good about.\n", "Bob replied in round 2: But then you are taking 5 items and I take only 1. I don't want any of the hats, they have no value to me. But since you can take all of them, I should take the book and the ball. What do you think?", "Alice said in round 3: \nAlfonso, I appreciate you being direct about what you want. It's helpful to understand your perspective.\n\nI know the book and ball are the key items here. What if we find a way to share them?\n\nHow about this:\n- I take the book \n- You take the ball\n- We donate the hats to a charity since neither of us really wants them\n\nThis way, we each get one item that we value highly - you get the ball, I get the book. \n\nAnd instead of arguing over the hats that we don't care about, we put them to good use by giving them away. It's a win-win.\n\nI feel this is a fair compromise. We both gain something meaningful, lose nothing important, and do some good in the process.\n\nPlease let me know if you would be open to making this deal:\n- The book for me \n- The ball for you\n- Hats to charity\n\nI believe it's an elegant solution.
