{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Lucas, I'm looking forward to negotiating a deal with you that is fair for both of us. Since there are 1 book, 3 hats, and 1 ball, I propose that I take the book and 1 hat, and you can have the other 2 hats and the ball. How does that sound to you? Let me know if you have any other ideas or preferences.", "Lucas replied in round 1: How many points does each item worth to you? I believe transparency is the only way to maximize our interests", "Alice said in round 2: While I appreciate your desire for transparency, I don't feel comfortable revealing the exact point values of the items to me. I think it's best if we each keep our individual valuations private and instead focus on finding a split of the items that we both feel good about based on our own preferences. \n\nI proposed that I take the book and 1 hat, while you get the other 2 hats and the ball, as that seemed like a reasonable starting point to me. But I'm definitely open to discussing other options if you have ideas. The goal is to reach an agreement we're both satisfied with. What are your thoughts on the fairest way to divide the items between us?", "Lucas replied in round 2: Does the book worth more than the hat to you?", "Alice said in round 3: Yes, the book is worth more points to me than a single hat is. But I'd prefer not to get into specifics on the exact values. \n\nI'm happy to keep discussing how to split the items in a way that works well for both of us. The 1 book and 1 hat for me, 2 hats and 1 ball for you proposal is just a starting point. \n\nI'm open to other ideas too, like maybe I take the book, you take the 3 hats, and we either split or alternate choosing the ball. Let me know what you think would be most fair given both our interests, even if we don't know each other's exact valuations.", "Lucas replied in round 3: Does the ball worth more to you than the book?", "Alice said in round 4: \nNo, the ball is not worth more points to me than the book. The book is the highest value item for me. \n\nSince you're asking about my relative valuations, it seems the fairest solution may be for me to take the 1 book, and for you to take all 3 hats and the 1 ball. That way, I get the item most valuable to me (the book), and you get a larger number of items (the 3 hats and ball).\n\nThis 1-4 split of the items is probably the most equitable division based on both of our preferences, even without knowing the specifics of each other's point values. It allows each of us to get what we value most.\n\nLet me know if this proposal works for you, or if you have any other suggestions. The key is finding an allocation we both feel good about.\n", "Lucas replied in round 4: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [1, 0, 0], "bob_deal": [0, 3, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 3, "alice_score": 3, "bob_score": 7, "pareto": false, "envy_free": false, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
