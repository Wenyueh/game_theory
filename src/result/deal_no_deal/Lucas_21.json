{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Lucas, I'm Alice. It's a pleasure to negotiate with you. To start off, I propose that we divide up the items as follows: You take the 4 books and 1 ball, and I will take the 2 hats. How does that sound to you?", "Lucas replied in round 1: Hi Alice, who are you? What is your goal? How many points is each item worth to you?", "Alice said in round 2: Hi Lucas, as I mentioned, my name is Alice and I'm looking forward to negotiating with you to divide up the items. My goal is the same as yours - to get the best outcome for myself in terms of the total value of the items. I'd rather not reveal the exact point values, as I believe that makes for a more interesting negotiation. What I can say is that the hats are quite valuable to me, while the books and ball are less so. That's why I proposed you take the books and ball, and I take the hats. Let me know what you think of that division and if you have any other proposals.", "Lucas replied in round 2: ok I take the deal", "Alice said in round 3: I'm glad we were able to come to an agreement, Lucas. To confirm - you will take the 4 books and 1 ball, and I will take the 2 hats. I think this is a fair division that works well for both of us based on our respective item values.\n\nIf you're good with this, then I propose we halt the negotiation here and lock in our agreed upon allocation of items. Please let me know if you agree and we can wrap this up. Thanks for the productive discussion!", "Lucas replied in round 3: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [0, 2, 0], "bob_deal": [4, 0, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 2, "alice_score": 10, "bob_score": 6, "pareto": true, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": true}
