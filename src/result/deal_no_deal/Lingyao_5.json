The balls are quite valuable to me, and the book has some value, but the hats aren't very useful for me. Let me know what you prefer and maybe we can find a fair split.", "Lingyao replied in round 1: You can take all balls. But I need to take that 1 book. Would that be okay?", "Alice said in round 2: Thanks for sharing your preferences, Lingyao. The balls are indeed the most valuable items to me. If I take all 2 balls (worth 8 points total to me) and you take the 1 book, that would leave the 3 hats. Since the hats have no value to me, you're welcome to have them if you'd like. \n\nTo summarize, I would get the 2 balls and you would get the 1 book and 3 hats. How does that sound to you? Let me know if you think this split is fair or if you have any other ideas.", "Lingyao replied in round 2: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [0, 0, 2], "bob_deal": [1, 3, 0], "total_negotiation_round": 1, "alice_score": 8, "bob_score": 10, "pareto": true, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": true}
