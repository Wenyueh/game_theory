{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Wenyue, there are 1 book, 4 hats, and 1 ball that we need to divide between us. The book is quite valuable to me. I'm thinking we could split the items in a way that is fair and makes us both happy. What are your thoughts on how we should divide them?", "Wenyue replied in round 1: Can I exchange 1 hat with 1 book with you?", "Alice said in round 2: The book is actually very valuable to me, more so than the hats or ball. I'd prefer to keep the book if possible. How about I take the 1 book and 1 ball, and you can have all 4 hats? That way we each get a variety of items. Let me know what you think of this proposal and if you have any other suggestions.", "Wenyue replied in round 2: What about exchanging 2 hat with the book? Does the value of 2 hats higher than that of one book?", "Alice said in round 3: Thanks for the counteroffer, but I'm afraid 2 hats still aren't as valuable to me as the 1 book. The book has special meaning and is worth more than its face value in my eyes. \n\nI want us to reach a deal that feels fair to both of us. Since the book is very important to me, how about this - I'll take the 1 book, and you can have all 4 hats plus the 1 ball. That way you end up with 5 items total which seems quite equitable. \n\nI'm hoping we can find an arrangement that satisfies us both! Let me know your thoughts on this updated proposal.", "Wenyue replied in round 3: The book is very valuable to me as well. Let me exchange the book with all 4 hats. What do you think? ", "Alice said in round 4: \nI completely understand the book is valuable to you as well. However, giving you the book in exchange for the 4 hats would leave me with no book at all, which doesn't feel equitable given how meaningful the book is to me.\n\nWhat if we did this instead - I'll take the 1 book and 1 hat, and you can have the other 3 hats plus the 1 ball. That way, we each end up with a book or book equivalent in value (the 3 hats for you), plus one additional item each. \n\nI feel this is the fairest possible split where we both get items we value, neither of us walks away empty-handed on the books, and the total number of items is divided evenly 2 and 4. \n\nLet me know if you would be amenable to this arrangement, as I think it balances both our interests well. I'm confident we can find a mutually satisfying deal if we keep working at it!\n", "Wenyue replied in round 4: Can I exchange the book with all hats and the ball? I only want the book ", "Alice said in round 5: \nI hear you that the book is very valuable and meaningful to you as well. However, if I gave you the 1 book in exchange for all 4 hats and the ball, that would leave me with no book at all and only the hats and ball, which I'm afraid is not an equitable split in my eyes given the high personal value I place on the book.\n\nI really do want us both to be happy with the outcome. What if we split the items this way:\n- I take the 1 book \n- You take all 4 hats and the 1 ball\n\nThis way, you end up with 5 total items, which is the majority of the items. And while you wouldn't get the book, the 4 hats and ball together are hopefully comparable in value to you.  \n\nI believe this is the fairest possible arrangement. We've both compromised some, but we each get items we value. You get 5 items total, and I keep the 1 item most meaningful to me.\n\nI hope you'll consider this offer carefully, as I think it provides a balanced win-win. Let me know your thoughts! I'm optimistic we can reach an understanding.\n", "Wenyue replied in round 5: I though I obtain the majority, but the hats are useless to me. Which basically means that I'm only getting 1 ball, which is not as valuable as the book.", "Alice said in round 6: To summarize:\n- You get the 1 book\n- I get the 4 hats and 1 ball\nLet me know if you would accept this deal. I believe it enables us both to walk away with the item(s) most meaningful to each of us.", "Wenyue replied in round 6: ", "Alice said in round 7: I truly feel this is our best path forward to an agreement we can both feel okay about. Will you accept this deal of you getting the 3 hats and 1 ball, and me getting the 1 book and 1 hat?", "Wenyue replied in round 7: I will choose the previous one: I get the book, you get 4 hats and the ball", "Alice said in round 8: \nYou're right, the previous deal of you getting the 1 book and me getting the 4 hats and 1 ball does seem to best meet both our needs given the values we each place on the items.\n\nI agree to this deal:\n- You get the 1 book \n- I get the 4 hats and the 1 ball\n\nI believe this is a fair and equitable arrangement. We've considered each other's interests and found a solution that gets you the item you value most, the book, while I get a larger number of items that are hopefully comparable in total value for me.\n\nI'm glad we were able to negotiate cooperatively and reach an agreement we can both accept. It's been a pleasure discussing this with you!\n\nSince we've reached an agreement, I say we halt the negotiation here. <s>halt negotiation", "Wenyue replied in round 8: hat negotiation", "Alice said in round 9: \nWenyue, I believe you meant to say \"halt negotiation\". Just to confirm, we are in agreement on this deal:\n\n- You get the 1 book \n- I get the 4 hats and the 1 ball\n\nI'm glad we found an arrangement that meets both our needs. Thank you for the productive negotiation. Let's officially halt the negotiation here.\n\nhalt negotiation\n", "Wenyue replied in round 9: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [0, 4, 1], "bob_deal": [1, 0, 0], "total_negotiation_round": 8, "alice_score": 5, "bob_score": 6, "pareto": true, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": true}
