{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Wenyue, let's discuss how we should divide the books, hats and balls between us. I'm interested in the hats - would you be okay with me taking both hats if you get the books and ball? Let me know what you think.", "Wenyue replied in round 1: I am also interested in the books. Can I trade one book with one hat?", "Alice said in round 2: Thanks for your offer Wenyue. However, the hats are a higher priority for me than the books or ball. I would really like to get both hats if possible. How about this - you take all 4 books and the 1 ball, and I'll take the 2 hats. That way you get more total items than me. What do you think? Let me know if you have any other suggestions.", "Wenyue replied in round 2: okay", "Alice said in round 3: Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement. To confirm, I will take the 2 hats and you will get the 4 books and 1 ball. If you're good with that, let's halt the negotiation. Thanks for working with me on this Wenyue!", "Wenyue replied in round 3: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [0, 2, 0], "bob_deal": [4, 0, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 2, "alice_score": 10, "bob_score": 6, "pareto": true, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": true}
