{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi alfonso, it looks like we have some books, hats and balls to divide between us. I think a fair split would be for me to get the hat and you to take the books and balls. The hat has more value to me, while the books and balls seem like they would be of more use to you. What do you think of that proposal?", "alfonso replied in round 1: Okay", "Alice said in round 2: Thanks for considering my proposal, but your short response of just \"Okay\" makes me think you may not be fully satisfied with it. The hat is quite valuable to me, but I recognize the books and balls likely have value to you too. Perhaps we could find a compromise - what if I took the hat and 1 book, and you took the remaining 1 book and all 3 balls? That way we each get a variety of items that are useful to us. Let me know your thoughts on that idea.", "alfonso replied in round 2: The hat is valued a lot to me. So I think it is fair that if you take, I should take all the other items. It's big a compromise to me to give you the hat. It is worth a vlue of 25 to me. ", "Alice said in round 3: I appreciate you sharing how highly you value the hat, alfonso. It's helpful to understand each other's perspectives. While the hat is also quite valuable to me, it sounds like it may be even more precious to you given the high value of 25 you placed on it. I want us to find an agreement we both feel good about.\n\nSince the hat seems to be the key item here, what if you took the hat and 1 ball, and I took the 2 books and 2 balls? That way you get the highly desirable hat plus an extra ball, while I get a larger quantity of the other items, which are still useful to me even if less valuable than the hat. This feels like it could be a reasonable middle ground. What are your thoughts on this proposal?", "alfonso replied in round 3: The balls are worth nothing to me, I could take the hat and 1 ball. I believe it is likely that the balls are worth something to you. I think this deal would optimize our collective value further. ", "Alice said in round 4: \nI understand the balls may not be very valuable to you, but you're correct that they do have some moderate value to me. Even though the hat is the most precious single item, the books and balls add up in total value for me.\n\nSince the hat is far more valuable to you, I agree you should have it. But taking all the other items in exchange feels a bit lopsided to me. \n\nHow about this - you take the prized hat and 1 book, I take the other book and all 3 balls. That way you get the two most valuable items (the hat and a book), while I get a higher quantity of items that are still somewhat useful to me (1 book and 3 balls). \n\nI believe this is the most equitable way to divide the items accounting for both of our interests. It allows you to obtain the hat you cherish, while ensuring I don't walk away with just low-value items. Let me know if you're amenable to this plan.\n", "alfonso replied in round 4: I agree with that deal. I take the 1 hat and 1 book. I think this is a fair split and we both win", "Alice said in round 5: halt negotiation", "alfonso replied in round 5: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [1, 0, 3], "bob_deal": [1, 1, 0], "total_negotiation_round": 4, "alice_score": 4, "bob_score": 9, "pareto": true, "envy_free": false, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
