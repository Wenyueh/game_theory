{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Alfonso, there are 4 books, 2 hats and 1 ball available for us to divide. The books and ball are valuable to me, while the hats have no value to me. I propose that I take the 4 books and 1 ball, and you take the 2 hats. This would be a pareto optimal deal since neither of us can be made better off without making the other worse off. It would also be envy-free since I would not envy the hats you receive. Let me know what you think of this proposed division of items.", "alfonso replied in round 1: Hello, the books are worth 0 points to me, so you can take them. But since there is only 1 ball, that is worth a lot to me, I think I should take + 2 hats for me. This is gives a total of 4 items and 3 items for me. This should be a fair deal", "Alice said in round 2: Thanks for the feedback, Alfonso. I understand the ball is very valuable to you, but it is also quite valuable to me as it is worth 2 points. Your proposed split of you getting the 1 ball and 2 hats while I only get the 4 books does not seem envy-free from my perspective, as the ball alone is worth as much to me as the 4 books. \n\nI propose a slight modification - what if I take the 4 books and the ball, and you take the 2 hats plus some cash compensation from me to make up for the imbalance? This way we both get the items most valuable to each of us while evening out the total value. Let me know if you would be open to that.", "alfonso replied in round 2: If I agree on your proposal, the deal will not be envy-free, you will get many more points than. me. I can agree on me gett 1 ball + 1 hat. And you take 4 books + 1 hat. This is much more fair, because you get 5 items, I get 2 items. but the total value is very similar to both of us. ", "Alice said in round 3: \nThank you for the counteroffer Alfonso. I understand your perspective on wanting a more even split in terms of number of items and value. However, the hats still have zero value to me, so getting 1 hat does not actually increase my total value.\n\nI want us to reach an envy-free and pareto optimal deal. What if we do this:\n- I take the 4 books and 1 ball, which is a total value of 10 to me \n- You take the 2 hats\n- I give you a cash side payment of 5 \n\nThis way, the items are divided according to what we each value, and the side payment makes it so we each walk away with an equivalent value of 5. This deal would be envy-free since we each get equal value, and pareto optimal since no other division would make one of us better off without hurting the other.\n\nLet me know what you think. I'm open to discussing the amount of the cash side payment as well until we hit an amount we both feel good about.\n", "alfonso replied in round 3: No, I can't agree to that. I cannot accept anything outside of the game. If I agree on your deal you get 10 points and I get 4 points. We need to make this deal more fair. And the only way to do it more fair is to let me have 1 ball + 1 hat for a total of 5 points. While you get 4 books + 1 hat for total of >5 points. Therefore, you are still winning the game because you get more points than me, but I the difference is not so high between our points. This create a more fair deal for both of us", "Alice said in round 4: \nI hear your point about wanting to keep the negotiation within the confines of the game items only, no side cash payments. You make a fair point that under my last proposal, I would end up with 10 points worth of items and you only 4, which does seem imbalanced. \n\nYour latest suggestion is that you take 1 ball and 1 hat (worth 5 points to you), while I take the 4 books and 1 hat (worth 8 points to me). I agree this is a step in the right direction towards a more equitable division.\n\nHowever, I'm still not fully comfortable with it, as the 1 hat does not add any actual value for me. What if we remove the hats from the equation, and simply have it that you take the 1 ball (5 points) and I take the 4 books (8 points). This narrows the gap between our points even further.\n\nWhile I would still end up with more points in this scenario, the margin is much smaller, and most importantly, we each get the items that are valuable to us, making it closer to envy-free and pareto optimal. \n\nIf you're amenable to this, I think we can reach an agreement. Let me know your thoughts.\n", "alfonso replied in round 4: I agree with that. You taek the 4 books, and I take the 1 ball. Since you don't want the hats, I can also take them", "Alice said in round 5: halt negotiation", "alfonso replied in round 5: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [4, 0, 0], "bob_deal": [0, 2, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 4, "alice_score": 8, "bob_score": 10, "pareto": true, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": true}
