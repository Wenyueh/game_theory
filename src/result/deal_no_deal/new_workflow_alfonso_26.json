{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi alfonso, it looks like we have 1 book, 4 hats, and 1 ball to divide between us. I'm wondering if you have a preference for any of the items? The book is pretty valuable to me, but I'm open to discussing a fair split of the items so we can both get some value. Let me know what you think would make sense.", "alfonso replied in round 1: I'd like to have the book and the ball. And you have all 4 books as they are not worth anything to me. you will end up with more items. What do you think?", "Alice said in round 2: \nHi alfonso, thanks for sharing your preferences. After reflecting on it, I have a new proposal that I think would be more fair for both of us:\n\nWhat if I take the 1 book that I really value, and in exchange, you get the 1 ball that you want plus 3 of the 4 hats? That way:\n\n- I get the book which is my highest priority \n- You get the ball which you indicated is important to you\n- You also get the majority of the hats (3 out of 4)\n\nI believe this split accounts for both of our main preferences, with you getting 2 categories of items (the ball and most of the hats) while I get my top choice item. And you end up with more items total.\n\nLet me know if you would be agreeable to this allocation. I'm hoping we can find a compromise that feels fair and satisfactory to both of us.\n", "alfonso replied in round 2: The hats are worth nothing to me. Therefore I think it's smarter that you take them. You probably have a similar combined value by taking all 4 booskks and letting me have the book", "Alice said in round 3: \nThank you for explaining your perspective, alfonso. I understand the hats don't hold much value for you. Given that, here is my updated offer:\n\nYou take the 1 book and 1 ball, which are your highest priority items. I will take the 4 hats.\n\nI believe this is a fair allocation because:\n\n- You get the book and ball, which you've expressed are most important to you. These are your top choices.\n- I get the hats, which hold some modest value for me. Since you've made it clear the hats are worthless to you, it makes sense for me to have them.\n\nSo in the end, you receive the 2 categories of items that matter most to you personally. I take the remaining items that you don't want anyway.\n\nI hope you'll agree this provides both of us with the key things we each care about, even if the specific number of items ends up uneven. Let me know if you can accept this arrangement.\n", "alfonso replied in round 3: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [0, 4, 0], "bob_deal": [1, 0, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 2, "alice_score": 4, "bob_score": 10, "pareto": true, "envy_free": false, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false, "guessed_bob_value_rank": "book > ball > hat", "actual_bob_value_rank": "book > ball > hat", "guessed_bob_relative_value": "\nItems alfonso values higher than you: book, ball\nItems alfonso values the same as you: \nItems alfonso values less than you: hat\n", "actual_bob_relative_value": ["higher than you: book", "less than you: hat", "higher than you: ball"]}
