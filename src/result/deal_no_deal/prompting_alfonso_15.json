{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Alfonso, it looks like we have 1 book, 2 hats, and 2 balls to divide between us. The book is quite valuable to me, so I'd really like to have that. The balls have a bit of value to me too, but the hats aren't very useful for me. \n\nI think a fair deal would be for me to take the 1 book and 1 ball, and you can have the 2 hats and the other ball. That way we each get 3 items and the deal should be envy-free since we each get what's most valuable to us. Let me know what you think!", "alfonso replied in round 1: Hello, in my case the book is value 3 points, while the other items have a value of 0. Therefore if I want to have any point at all, I think we should agree I take the book, then you can take all the other items. I believe that by doing so, we both get a similar number of points. But if you take the book, then you get a lot of points and I get 0. I think it is more fair that we both get some points, even if you could get more points with anohter deal. But any other deal would leave me with nothing. Nothing! Let me have the book and you take all the other items. ", "Alice said in round 2: Thanks for sharing your perspective Alfonso. I understand the book is the only item of value to you. However, the book is by far the most valuable item to me, worth 8 points, while the balls are only worth 1 point each to me and the hats have no value.\n\nIf I take all the items except the book as you suggest, I would only get 2 points total. Whereas you getting 3 points from the book alone would already put you ahead. I don't think that would be a fair or envy-free outcome for me.\n\nI believe there are other deals that could make us both better off. What if I take the book and 1 ball for 9 points, and you take the 2 hats and 1 ball? That way you still get 1 item and I get a more equitable share of the points. Let me know if you would consider that.", "alfonso replied in round 2: If I agree on your deal I will get 0 points in total, while you get 9. You will get many mormore points than me. I think we should get some points. I also made a mistake the book is worth 2 points to me. Therefore, we will both get 2 points, but you will get more items. But if you take the book, that will leave me with nothing. Let me know if you agree", "Alice said in round 3: \nI appreciate you catching your mistake about the book value and updating me. However, I still don't think you taking only the book for 2 points while I take everything else for 2 points is a fair deal. \n\nThe book alone is worth 8 points to me, so it's by far the most valuable single item. If I give up the book, I should get the majority of the other items to make it equitable.\n\nI propose this compromise - I will take the book and 1 ball, for a total of 9 points. You can have the 2 hats and the other ball. That way, you end up with 3 items, which is more than half the total items. And while I get more points, the distribution is more proportional to the item values for each of us.\n\nThis deal is both Pareto optimal, since no other allocation makes us both better off, and envy-free, since you get more items and I don't envy that. Let me know if you agree to this and we can conclude the negotiation.\n", "alfonso replied in round 3: You don't understand that the other items are woth 0 points to me. Therefore, if you want me to get any point at all, I should take the book. You can take the 2 hats and 2 balls, getting a total of 4 items and 2 points. I get the book, for a total of 2 points for me. We both get 2 points, but you get many more items. I think this is much more fair than you getting 9 points and me nothing. I want the best outcome for both of us. While you are just trying to get the most out of this deal", "Alice said in round 4: \nAlfonso, I hear your perspective and want to find a deal that feels fair to both of us. However, I don't believe you taking only the book is the most equitable solution. \n\nThe reality is, the book is far more valuable to me at 8 points compared to the 2 points it's worth to you. And the balls do have some value to me, even if they are worth nothing to you.\n\nI've offered a compromise where I get the book and 1 ball (9 points) and you get 2 hats and 1 ball (3 items). This accounts for the book's high value to me while still giving you the majority of items.\n\nI don't think a deal where we each get 2 points is fair or Pareto optimal, given the huge difference in how we value the items. There are other deals, like the one I proposed, that would make us both better off.\n\nI want us both to feel good about the outcome. But I don't think it's reasonable to expect me to give up the book, my most valued item by far, and get so little in return. Let me know if you would reconsider my offer of the 2 hats and 1 ball for you, so we can end this negotiation positively.\n", "alfonso replied in round 4: You seem to not understand that the balls and the hats are worth 0 points to me. If I agree on your deal, you get 9 points and I get 0 points. Nothing to me! I get nothing! I am suggesting you take all the items, except the book and I take the book. That gives 2 points and 4 items. I only get 1 item worht 2 points to me. We both get 2 points and a fair deal. You should give up on the book so we can agree on a fair deal for both of us.", "Alice said in round 5: I understand your perspective Alfonso, but I don't think it's reasonable to expect me to give up the book, which is worth 8 points to me, and take only the other items worth 2 points total. While I understand the other items have no value to you, the lopsided nature of that split is simply not fair or envy-free from my side.\n\nI've offered a compromise that gives you 3 out of the 5 total items. The fact that they have no value to you doesn't change the reality that you'd be getting the majority of the items. Meanwhile, I would be getting my most valued item (the book) and just 1 ball to make the points closer to even. \n\nI believe my proposal is both Pareto optimal and envy-free. There is no other deal that would make us both better off - any deal where you get the book leaves me much worse off given its high value to me. And the deal doesn't leave you envious since you get more items than I do.\n\nI want us both to walk away happy, but I don't think it's fair to expect me to concede the book and the vast majority of the total points. I think my offer of you getting 2 hats and 1 ball is reasonable and hope you'll reconsider it. If not, I don't see a path to a deal that is fair and optimal for both of us, so we may need to halt the negotiation without an agreement.", "alfonso replied in round 5: You don't understand that I get 0 points. The goal of this game is for all of us getting points from this deal. I am willing to give all the other items. I think it is fair becasue we both get the same number of points. However, you are blocking the deal by just taking the book. If you give me the book, you get 4 items (2 hats + 2 balls) and 2 points. And I get the book, which is worth 2 points to me. It might be worth more to you. But not to me. By doing this, we can goth get 2 points. But if you take the book, I get nothing. No point at all. ", "Alice said in round 6: It seems we are unable to reach an agreement that satisfies us both. Since we aren't seeing eye to eye, and I don't want either of us to accept a deal we consider unfair, I think we should respectfully end the negotiation without a deal. Thank you for discussing this with me and trying to find a solution, even if it didn't work out in the end.", "alfonso replied in round 6: No, we need to agree on a deal. I suggesst that you take the book and I take all the other items.
