{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Wenyue, it's nice to negotiate with you. Since there are 1 books, 3 hats, and 1 balls in total, I think a fair split would be for me to take the 1 book and 2 hats, and you can have the remaining 1 hat and 1 ball. How does that sound to you?", "Wenyue replied in round 1: What about I trade one hat with your book?", "Alice said in round 2: \nI appreciate your counter offer, but the book is quite valuable to me. How about this - you can have the 1 ball and 2 of the hats, and I'll take the 1 book and the remaining 1 hat. I think that would be a balanced split of the items. Let me know what you think!\n", "Wenyue replied in round 2: The ball is of no value to me, however. But I really need to book", "Alice said in round 3: I understand the book is important to you, but it's also very valuable to me. How about a compromise - I'll let you have the book, and in exchange I'll take all 3 hats. That way we each get an item that holds significant value for us. I'm willing to concede the book to you if I can have the hats in return. Do we have a deal?", "Wenyue replied in round 3: okay, I will then take the 3 hats and the ball", "Alice said in round 4: To clarify, I'm proposing that you get the 1 book that you really need, and I will take the 3 hats. We can leave the ball out of the deal. \n\nThis way, you get the book which is most valuable to you, and I get the hats which are more valuable to me than the book or ball. I think this is the fairest compromise.\n\nLet me know if you agree to this - you take the book, I take the 3 hats, and we leave the ball. If so, we can make a deal!", "Wenyue replied in round 4: Let's don't leave anything out in the deal. Since the ball is useless to you, let me have it and neither of us will lose anything", "Alice said in round 5: \nI see your point about not leaving anything out of the deal. However, the ball really provides no additional value to me. My goal is to reach a fair agreement where we each optimize our own outcomes.\n\nI'm happy to let you have the book which you really need, even though it's valuable to me too. And in return, the 3 hats provide the most value to me. So I think the most balanced deal is for you to take the book and ball, and for me to take the 3 hats. \n\nThis is my best and final offer. If you agree, then we can conclude the negotiation successfully. Please let me know if you accept - you get the 1 book and 1 ball, and I get the 3 hats. Let's shake on it!\n", "Wenyue replied in round 5: Sounds good", "Alice said in round 6: halt negotiation", "Wenyue replied in round 6: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [0, 3, 0], "bob_deal": [1, 0, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 5, "alice_score": 6, "bob_score": 7, "pareto": true, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": true}
