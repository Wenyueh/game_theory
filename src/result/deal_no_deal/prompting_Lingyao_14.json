{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Lingyao, it looks like there are 1 book, 3 hats, and 1 ball available. The book has a value of 10 to me, while the hats and ball have no value to me. I propose that I take the book, and you can have the 3 hats and 1 ball. This would maximize my value, and hopefully provide you some value from the hats and ball. Let me know what you think of this proposed split of the items. I'm open to discussing further to see if we can reach an agreement that is fair and acceptable to both of us.", "Lingyao replied in round 1: Sounds good. But I accept this offer as this may be pareto optimization for both of us. Hat means 1 points, and balls mean 5 for me. You will get 10 points, while I will get 8 points. ", "Alice said in round 2: Great, I'm glad we were able to reach an agreement so quickly that is satisfactory to both of us. You taking the 3 hats and 1 ball for 8 points of value, while I take the 1 book for 10 points of value, does seem to be a pareto optimal solution. There is no other allocation that would make one of us better off without making the other worse off. \n\nIt also appears to be an envy-free solution, as I do not envy the 8 points you are getting from the hats and ball, and presumably you do not envy the 10 points I am getting from the book. So I believe we have found a deal that meets both key principles.\n\nSince we are in agreement, I propose we halt the negotiation here and finalize our respective item allocations. Please let me know if you concur.", "Lingyao replied in round 2: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [1, 0, 0], "bob_deal": [0, 3, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 1, "alice_score": 10, "bob_score": 8, "pareto": true, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": true}
