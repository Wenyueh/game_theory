{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Lingyao, let's discuss how we can make a deal that benefits both of us. I propose the following distribution: I will take both books and the hat, while you can have both balls. This way, I will get a total value of 10 (2 books + 6 hat), and you will get a total value of 0 (2 balls). This distribution is pareto optimal because there is no other way to redistribute the items that would make both of us better off. Additionally, this deal is envy free because I do not envy the reward you are getting. What do you think about this proposal?", "Lingyao replied in round 1: o. I hope to have 1 hat and 2 balls", "Alice said in round 2: Hi Lingyao, I understand your preference for 1 hat and 2 balls. Let's try to find a solution that benefits both of us. How about this: I will take both books and the remaining hat, while you can have both balls and the other hat. This way, I will get a total value of 10 (2 books + 6 hat), and you will get a total value of 6 (1 hat). This distribution is pareto optimal because there is no other way to redistribute the items that would make both of us better off.

I need to have that as you've already have 2 books", "Alice said in round 3: Hi Lingyao, I understand your point about the hat. Let's try to find a fair solution.

Balls do not mean anything to me. I've already let you to have the books, so can I have the hat?", "Alice said in round 4: Hi Lingyao, I understand your perspective on the hat.
