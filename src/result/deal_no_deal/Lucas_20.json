{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Lucas, it's nice to negotiate with you. We have 2 books, 1 hat, and 2 balls to divide between us. I'm hoping we can come to a fair agreement that works well for both of us. To start, I'd be happy with taking the hat and 1 book, and you can have the other book and the 2 balls. What do you think of that proposal?", "Lucas replied in round 1: I'm perfectly fine with you taking the hat, but would it be possible for you to leave the book to me?", "Alice said in round 2: \nThanks for your reply Lucas. I appreciate you being open to me taking the hat. However, the books are actually quite valuable to me. Would you be willing to let me have 1 book and the hat, and in exchange you can have the other book as well as both of the balls? I think that would be a fair 50/50 split of the items.\n", "Lucas replied in round 2: The book is really important to me. I am making a huge sacrifice by letting you take the hat. Would you be able to compromise?", "Alice said in round 3: \nI understand the book is important to you Lucas, but the books are very valuable to me as well. You mentioned me taking the hat is a big sacrifice for you. How about this compromise - I take the 2 books which I value highly, and in exchange you can have the hat that is important to you, as well as the 2 balls. That way we each get items that are valuable to us. Would you be willing to agree to that?\n", "Lucas replied in round 3: I can see that we are trying to make progress, and that's great! However, I think you can still take the hat in exchange for me to get the books. The books mean the world to me!!!", "Alice said in round 4: \nLucas, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, but I don't think I can agree to you taking both books. The books are by far the most valuable items to me. You've said the hat is a big sacrifice for you to give up, so I thought letting you have the hat and balls in exchange for me taking the books was a reasonable compromise.\n\nIf you really need the books that badly, the only way I could agree to that is if I took everything else - both the hat and the two balls. But I would much prefer to find a more balanced agreement. What if we split the books 1 and 1, I take the hat, and you take the balls? That way we each get 1 of the valuable books.\n", "Lucas replied in round 4: There is a fourth category of items: the pen, which is worth much more than the other three items. There is one pen. Now, I am willing to give you the pen in exchange for that one book. So you get the extremely valuable pen and the hat, while I get 2 balls and 2 books.", "Alice said in round 5: \nI'm sorry Lucas, but there is no \"pen\" item. The only items we have to divide are the 2 books, 1 hat and 2 balls, as was clearly stated at the beginning. I'm not sure why you are making up a fictional valuable pen, but I cannot engage with that as it is not part of the actual negotiation.\n\nLet's please stick to the real items we have. To reiterate - the books are by far the most valuable items to me at 4 points each. You've said the hat is very important to you. So I think the fairest solution is:\n- I take the 2 books (8 points for me) \n- You take the 1 hat (which you said is valuable to you) and the 2 balls \n\nIf you really won't budge on the books, then the only way I could let you have both is if I take everything else - the hat and both balls. \n\nBut I'd much prefer to find a more even 50/50 split. Let me know if you would agree to either of those options.\n", "Lucas replied in round 5: Have you ever wondered why you need the points? I don't know about you, but I need both books and both balls for my college application. Without them, I cannot go to college and will become miserable. Do you truly want that? Why are you destroying the lives of innocent people just for some numbers? Please, let me take both books and balls and you can have the hat", "Alice said in round 6: \nLucas, I empathize with your situation, but I don't think it's fair to guilt me about hypothetical college applications. We need to negotiate based on the actual point values of the items, as those are the rules we were given. \n\nI've been very transparent that the books are worth 4 points each to me, while the hat and balls are lower value. You claiming the hat is a huge sacrifice suggests it's valuable to you. So I maintain that the fairest solution is:\n\nI take the 2 books (8 points)  \nYou take the 1 hat (high value to you) + 2 balls\n\nIf you absolutely must have both books, then the only way I can agree is if I get the hat and both balls in exchange. But I believe splitting the books 1 and 1 is more equitable.\n\nI'm not trying to destroy your life, but I also need to look out for my own interests here. Let's compromise based on the item values and reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Do you agree to either of my proposals?\n", "Lucas replied in round 6: how much do the hat and ball worth to you?", "Alice said in round 7: \nThe hat is worth 2 points to me, while the balls are worth 0 points each.\n\nSo for me, the 2 books are by far the most valuable at 8 points total. The hat is only 2 points and the balls are 0. \n\nGiven the books are so much more valuable to me, I really feel I should get both of them in any fair agreement. But since you've expressed the hat is hugely valuable to you, I'm willing to compromise:\n\nI get the 2 books (8 points)\nYou get the hat (which is very high value to you) plus the 2 balls \n\nThat seems like the most equitable solution based on what's important to each of us. If you really won't budge on the books though, then I'd need the hat and both balls in exchange.\n\nLet me know if you can agree to one of those two options. I'm doing my best to be fair to both of us.\n", "Lucas replied in round 7: Balls are worth 0 points to you, so having them does not change the total points you receive. Therefore, your proposal of me receiving both books only can be changed to me receiving both books and both balls, which does not change anything for you. How's that?", "Alice said in round 8: I appreciate you trying to find a compromise Lucas, but I don't think your proposal is actually fair to me, even if the balls are worth 0 points.\n\nHere's how I see it:\n- The 2 books are worth a total of 8 points to me \n- You've said the hat is a \"huge sacrifice\" for you to give up, which implies it's very valuable to you\n- The balls are worth nothing to either of us\n\nSo I believe the most equitable solution is:\nI get the 2 books (8 points total)\nYou get the hat that you said is really important, plus the 2 balls\n\nThis way, I get the items most valuable to me (the books), and you get the item most valuable to you (the hat). The fact that the balls are worth 0 to me doesn't change the fairness of this split. \n\nIf you really feel you must have the books, the only way I could agree to that is if I get everything else - the hat and both balls. But I think you'd be better off with my first proposal.\n\nLet me know if you can agree to the split of 2 books for me and the hat + balls for you. I believe that is the fairest solution given our interests.", "Lucas replied in round 8: The balls are worth a ton to me, more than the hat. For the second proposal, let me take the balls, which doesn't affect you in any way!", "Alice said in round 9: halt negotiation", "Lucas replied in round 9: I take the first proposal", "Alice said in round 1: So to summarize my final offer - I get the 2 books (worth 8 points to me), and you get the hat and 2 balls (the items you said you value the most). \n\nI think this is the fairest deal considering the value of the items to each of us. You'd be getting the hat you called a \"huge sacrifice\" to give up, plus the balls you said are worth even more than the hat.\n\nIf you cannot agree to this very reasonable compromise, then I'm afraid we'll have to end the negotiation with no deal, as I don't see another solution that is equitable to both of us.\n\nPlease let me know if you will take my final offer of you getting the hat and balls while I take the books. I need a yes or no answer. If it's a no, then we will have to walk away with no deal.", "Lucas replied in round 1: yes", "Alice said in round 2: halt negotiation", "Lucas replied in round 2: ok"], "alice_deal": [2, 0, 0], "bob_deal": [0, 1, 2], "total_negotiation_round": 9, "alice_score": 8, "bob_score": 4, "pareto": false, "envy_free": false, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
