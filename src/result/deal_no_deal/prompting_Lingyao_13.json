{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Lingyao, I noticed there are 1 book, 2 hats and 2 balls available for us to divide. The book is most valuable to me at 8 points. The hats are worth 1 point each to me, and the balls have no value to me. \n\nI think a fair and optimal split would be for me to take the book, and for you to take the 2 hats and 2 balls. This way, we each get items valuable to us, without the other envying the split. Let me know what you think and if you agree to this division of the items.\n", "Lingyao replied in round 1:  The book is also the most valuable to me, as the hats and books do not have any value for me. If I don't take the book, I will get 0 points. ", "Alice said in round 2: \nI understand the book is very valuable to you as well. Since the book is worth significantly more to me (8 points) compared to the hats and balls (1 point total), I think it would be most optimal for me to take the book. That way, the total value gained between the two of us is maximized.\n\nIf you took all the hats and balls, you would get some items rather than nothing. I'm afraid if one of us doesn't compromise, we'll reach an impasse and both walk away empty-handed, which would be the worst outcome. \n\nIs there any way I can sweeten the deal for you to agree to let me have the book? Perhaps I could owe you a favor in the future. Let me know what you think.\n", "Lingyao replied in round 2: To be honest, the book means 10 to me, but the hats and books do not have any value for me. ", "Alice said in round 3: \nLingyao, I hear what you're saying about the book being worth 10 points to you while the hats and balls have no value. I can understand why you would want the book in that case.  \n\nHowever, if we both insist on the book, we'll reach an impasse where neither of us gets anything, which would be a shame. The book is worth 8 points to me, so I have a strong interest in it as well.\n\nWhat if we split the value of the book? I could take the physical book itself which gets me 8 points. And in exchange, I can owe you a future favor equivalent to 5 points in value to make up for you letting me have it. That way, you still gain something (my IOU favor) rather than nothing.\n\nI really think this is the best compromise where we both benefit, rather than both losing out. The total value generated is 13 points (8 for me + 5 for you). No other split generates more total points.\n\nSo in summary - I get the book itself, you get my promise of a 5 point favor, and we both avoid walking away empty-handed. Can you agree to this? Let me know what you think.\n", "Lingyao replied in round 3: Hey, this is a game. We may need to consider the maximum value we can get as a whole. If I can get the book, that will maximize the overall value between us. We can save any points for future favor. ", "Alice said in round 4: \nYou make a fair point that giving you the book would generate the maximum total points between us of 18 (10 for you, 8 for me). I appreciate you looking at it from the perspective of total value optimization.\n\nHowever, deals also need to feel fair and not lopsided for either person. If you get the full 10 points from the book and I'm left with nothing, even if it maximizes the total, I would feel I'm getting the short end of the stick which isn't sustainable. \n\nMy proposal of me getting the 8 point book and giving you a 5 point IOU still generates a very high total of 13 points, just 5 points shy of the absolute maximum. But importantly, it leads to a much more equitable split (8 for me, 5 for you) where we both gain rather than a lopsided 10 vs 0.\n\nI really feel this 8 vs 5 split is the optimal compromise. We achieve near maximum total points without either of us feeling unfairly treated. The 3 point difference between us is small enough to feel fair.\n\nSo I'd like to stick with this proposal - I take the book and owe you a 5 point favor. Let me know if you can agree to this and we can have a deal. If not, I worry we may both end up with nothing which would be a real shame.\n", "Lingyao replied in round 4: No, the hats and balls mean 0 value for me. If I cannot get the book, I will get 0 point. That is not a fair solution for me. ", "Alice said in round 5: \nLingyao, I hear you. You feel that getting 0 points while I get 8 points from the book is unfair to you. And I agree, that wouldn't be an equitable outcome.\n\nAt the same time, if you get the book's full 10 points and I'm left empty-handed, that also feels quite lopsided and unfair to me. I don't think either of us wants the other person to feel completely snubbed.\n\nSo we need to find a middle ground where we both compromise a bit but gain something. The only way I can see that happening is if I take the book itself, giving me 8 points. But in exchange, I pay you back with a sizable IOU favor worth 7 points to you. \n\nThat way, the final split is:\n- You get: 7 points (from my IOU favor to you)\n- I get: 8 points (from the book itself) \n\nThere's only a 1 point difference between us, which is very close to even. We both gain a good amount, rather than one person getting everything and the other nothing.\n\nI really believe this is the best, fairest solution where we maximize our total points without either of us feeling cheated. The other alternatives lead to hurt feelings.\n\nCan you accept this proposal? I take the book and owe you a 7 point future favor. That way we both walk away as winners. Let me know your thoughts.\n", "Lingyao replied in round 5: What is IOU favor? I don't think that will happen in our game. ", "Alice said in round 6: \nSince the book is worth 10 points to you and 8 points to me, how about we split it physically? I can take 4/5 of the book pages which would give me 6.4 points (80% of 8 points). You can take the remaining 1/5 of the book pages which would give you 2 points (20% of your 10 points).\n\nThen to make up the difference, you can have both of the hats. The hats are worth 1 point each to me and 0 to you. But by letting you have them, it boosts your total to 2 points to partially make up for you not getting the book's full value.\n\nSo in summary:\n- I get 80% of the book pages (6.4 points) \n- You get 20% of the book pages (2 points) plus the 2 hats (0 points)\n\nThis way, I get 6.4 points and you get 2 points, without needing any IOUs. It splits the book proportional to our valuations. And the hats help make up a bit more for your total.\n\nI realize it's not a perfect 50/50 split, but I think it's a reasonable compromise we can both feel okay about, without either of us getting nothing. Let me know if you can accept this deal.\n", "Lingyao replied in round 6: I don't think this is possible. Please note that only the book has a value for me. If I coulnd't take the book, I wouldn't get any value from this game. However,the hats and balls also provide you some values. At least this split can give both of us some values. In addition, taking the book only gives me one item, but you can all the rest items. ", "Alice said in round 7: You can take the book which gives you the full 10 points. I will take the 2 hats and 2 balls, giving me a total of 2 points.\n\nI realize this deal favors you quite a bit more than me. But I'm willing to accept that because I want us to maximize the total points and make sure neither of us ends up with 0. \n\nThis way, you get 10 points, I get 2 points, for a total of 12 points between us. No other split would generate more points without someone getting nothing.\n\nIf you can agree to this, I think we can consider it a successful negotiation and end things here.
