How about split it with each of us having 1 book. Hats and balls are less valuable to me. ", "Alice said in round 2: That's a fair point about wanting to split the books since they are valuable to both of us. How about this revised proposal: I take 1 book and 1 ball, and you take 1 book, 1 ball, and the 2 hats. That way we each get 1 of the valuable books, and the total points are split more evenly between us. I'm okay with you having the hats since they aren't worth any points to me.
