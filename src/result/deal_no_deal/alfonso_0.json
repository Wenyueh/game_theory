{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Alfonso, thanks for negotiating with me on dividing up these items. Based on the values, it looks like the hats are worth the most to me at 3 points each, while the books and balls are only worth 1 point each to me. Since there are 2 hats, I propose that I take both hats, and you can have the 1 book and all 3 balls. That way, I would get 6 points worth of items, and you would get 4 items, even though they are lower in value to me. Let me know if this split works for you. If not, I'm open to discussing other options.", "alfonso replied in round 1: Agreed", "Alice said in round 2: Great, I'm glad we were able to come to an agreement. To confirm, I will take the 2 hats, and you will take the 1 book and 3 balls. Let's halt the negotiation here since we have a deal.
