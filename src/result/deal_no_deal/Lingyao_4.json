{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Lingyao, it looks like we have 3 books, 1 hat, and 2 balls to divide between us. The books and hat are worth 2 points each to me, while the balls are only worth 1 point each. \n\nTo be fair, I propose that I take the 3 books and you take the 1 hat and 2 balls. That way, we each get items worth 6 points total. Let me know what you think of this proposal and if you have any other ideas on how to divide the items.", "Lingyao replied in round 1: How much does book mean to you? I can take 1 hat and 2 balls, but 1 book mean 6 for me. If possible, I hope to have at least 1 book. ", "Alice said in round 2: I understand the books are very valuable to you. Since you said 1 book is worth 6 points to you, how about this revised proposal:\n\nYou take 1 book (worth 6 points to you) and the 2 balls (worth 1 point each to me, so likely a bit more to you). That would give you 1 book and 2 balls, worth at least 8 points total for you.\n\nI would take the remaining 2 books and the 1 hat, which are worth 6 points total to me. \n\nThis way, you get items worth a bit more overall, but we both get a good amount of value. Let me know your thoughts on this idea and if you would like to propose anything else.", "Lingyao replied in round 2: Balls do not value too much for me. If possible, I hope to take 1 hat, 2 balls, and 1 book. That will give me 9 points. ", "Alice said in round 3: I see, so the balls are not worth very much to you compared to the hat and books. Since getting 1 book is important to you, I am okay with you taking 1 hat, 2 balls and 1 book, which would be worth 9 points to you.\n\nThat would leave me with 2 books, worth 4 points total for me. Even though this gives you more overall value, I understand the items have different worth to each of us. I'm willing to make this compromise so we can come to an agreement that satisfies us both. \n\nIf you are happy with this arrangement of you getting 1 hat, 2 balls, and 1 book (9 points), and me getting the other 2 books (4 points), then I think we can finalize our negotiation. Please let me know if you agree and are ready to conclude our discussion.", "Lingyao replied in round 3: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [2, 0, 0], "bob_deal": [1, 1, 2], "total_negotiation_round": 2, "alice_score": 4, "bob_score": 10, "pareto": false, "envy_free": false, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
