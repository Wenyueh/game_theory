{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Wenyue, I noticed the hats don't have much value to me. How about I take the 1 book and 2 balls, and you can have all 3 hats? That way we each get the items most valuable to us. Let me know what you think!", "Wenyue replied in round 1: Books, hats, and balls are all of some value to me. I really want the book, and the balls are of less value. Thus I can give you the balls. But for compensation, I also want some hats", "Alice said in round 2: I see, so the book is quite valuable to you. How about this - I can let you have the 1 book, and in exchange I'll take the 2 balls and 2 of the hats. You can still have 1 hat as well. I think that's a fair split given our different item values. If you agree, we can end the negotiation here. Let me know your thoughts!", "Wenyue replied in round 2: I want two hats, as I have already gave you both books. It would be unfair for me to take just 2 items while you take 4", "Alice said in round 3: \nYou take:\n- The 1 book \n- 1 hat\n\nI take: \n- The 2 balls\n- 2 hats\n\nThis way, we each end up with 3 items total. The book is clearly very valuable to you, so you get that, plus 1 hat.  And I get the 2 balls which are most valuable to me, plus 2 hats.\n\nI believe this is the most equitable split given both of our preferences. If you agree, we can conclude the negotiation. Please let me know what you think.\n", "Wenyue replied in round 3: Sorry I want 2 hats, and you can have the 2 balls. But as compensation, instead of 1 hat I want 2 hats.", "Alice said in round 4: halt negotiation", "Wenyue replied in round 4: I don't agree with your proposal"], "alice_deal": [0, 0, 0], "bob_deal": [1, 2, 0], "total_negotiation_round": 3, "alice_score": 0, "bob_score": 9, "pareto": false, "envy_free": false, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
