{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Alfonso, thanks for negotiating with me. Since there are 1 book, 3 hats, and 1 ball total, I propose the following deal:\n\nI get:\n- The 1 book\n\nYou get: \n- The 3 hats\n- The 1 ball\n\nThe book is worth 10 points to me, while the hats and ball are worth 0 to me. So this deal would give me a total value of 10.\n\nI believe this deal is fair and envy-free, since we each get the items that are valuable to us. It also seems Pareto optimal, as there is no other allocation that would make both of us better off.\n\nLet me know what you think of this proposal and if you would like to make any adjustments. I'm open to discussing further to come to an agreement we both feel good about.\n", "alfonso replied in round 1: I agree", "Alice said in round 2: Great, I'm happy we were able to come to an agreement so quickly! Since you accept the deal as I proposed, where I get the 1 book and you get the 3 hats and 1 ball, let's go ahead and finalize that.\n\nI believe this deal is optimal for both of us, giving each of us the items most valuable to us individually while still being equitable. Thanks for the smooth and successful negotiation.\n\nhalt negotiation", "alfonso replied in round 2: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [1, 0, 0], "bob_deal": [0, 3, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 1, "alice_score": 10, "bob_score": 8, "pareto": true, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": true}
