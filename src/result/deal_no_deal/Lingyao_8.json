{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Lingyao, I noticed the ball is worth a lot more points to me than the books and hats. I'm wondering if the item values are different for you? If so, maybe we can find an agreement that maximizes points for both of us, like me taking the ball and you taking the books and hats, depending on what's more valuable to you. What do you think?", "Lingyao replied in round 1:  Only ball has meaning for me. If possible, I can take that 1 ball, while you take all of the rest. ", "Alice said in round 2: The ball is the most valuable item to me as well, worth 5 points compared to only 1 point each for the books and hats. So I'd really prefer to keep the ball for myself if possible. If you took all the books and hats, that would be 5 items worth a total of 5 points to me. I'd be willing to let you have all of those if I can keep the 1 ball. Does that sound reasonable to you? It would allow us both to get the item(s) most valuable to each of us.", "Lingyao replied in round 2: The ball means 8 for me, while book means nothing for me. You can take all the 3 books and 2 hats. ", "Alice said in round 3: I appreciate you sharing the item values for you, Lingyao. Since the ball is worth more to you than to me, while the books and hats are worthless to you, I think your proposed split makes sense. You can take the 1 ball (8 points for you), and I will take the 3 books and 2 hats (5 points total for me). This way we both get positive value and neither of us winds up with items we don't want. If you agree, I'm ready to accept this deal.", "Lingyao replied in round 3: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [3, 2, 0], "bob_deal": [0, 0, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 2, "alice_score": 5, "bob_score": 8, "pareto": true, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": true}
