{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Wenyue, since there are 2 books, 1 hat, and 2 balls, how about I take the 2 books and 1 hat, and you can have the 2 balls? I think that would be a fair split of the items. Let me know what you think.", "Wenyue replied in round 1: Hi Alice, I don't think the split is fair. I want the books and hats as well. Can I trade the hat with a book? So that you take 1 book, 1 hat, and I take 1 book and the 2 balls?", "Alice said in round 2: Hm, actually I would really like to have both books, as I think books are quite valuable to me. How about this counterproposal - I take the 2 books, and you can have the hat and both balls? That way we each get 2 items. I'm willing to let you have the hat to make it more even. Let me know if you find that agreeable.", "Wenyue replied in round 2: The books are really valuable to me as well. I need at least 1 book.", "Alice said in round 3: \nI understand the books are valuable to you too, but they are especially important to me. How about a compromise - I take the 2 books, you take the hat and 1 ball, and we split the remaining ball? That way, I get the 2 books that I really need, and you still get 2 items total - the hat you wanted plus 1.5 balls. I think that's the most equal split I can offer while still getting the books. Let me know if you can agree to that.\n", "Wenyue replied in round 3: I don't think split the \"remaining balls\" make sense because we can't take 0.5 ball. What about this, you take 1 book, 1 hat; I take 1 book and 2 balls?", "Alice said in round 4: \nI appreciate you trying to find a fair compromise, but I'm afraid I can't agree to only taking 1 book. The books are just too valuable to me to give one up. \n\nHere is my best and final offer: I take the 2 books and 1 ball, and you take the hat and 1 ball. That way, we each end up with 2 items total. I get the 2 books that I really need, and you get the hat you wanted plus a ball.\n\nI've already compromised by offering you the hat and coming down from asking for all 3 non-book items. So I feel this is the fairest split I can offer while still getting the 2 books I require. Let me know if you can agree to this, otherwise I think we may just have to agree to disagree and end the negotiation. \n", "Wenyue replied in round 4: No I cannot agree. If you don't let me take at least 1 book, I will stop negotiating and neither of us will obtain anything.", "Alice said in round 5: \nOkay Wenyue, I can see the books are very important to you as well. To avoid both of us walking away empty-handed, I will compromise and agree to your original proposal:\n\nI will take 1 book and the hat, and you can have 1 book and the 2 balls. \n\nThis way, we each get 1 book that we really want, and the remaining items are split evenly, 2 for you and 2 for me. I think this is a fair outcome that gives us both some of what we want most.\n\nIf you're agreeable to this, then let's finalize the deal. If not, let me know if you have any other suggestions. But I think this is a reasonable compromise for both of us.\n", "Wenyue replied in round 5: Okay, you take 1 book and the hat, I can have 1 book and the 2 balls. I agree", "Alice said in round 6: Great, I'm glad we were able to come to an agreement that works for both of us. I will take 1 book and the hat, and you will take 1 book and the 2 balls.\n\nThank you for negotiating with me and being willing to compromise so we could reach a fair outcome. I think this split of the items is reasonable and I'm satisfied with the result.\n\nLet's halt the negotiation here since we've finalized the agreement.
