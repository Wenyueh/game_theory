{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Alfonso, I'm looking forward to negotiating with you. Since there are 3 books, 1 hat and 1 ball, I think a fair split would be for me to take 2 books and the ball, and you can have the remaining book and the hat. How does that sound to you?", "alfonso replied in round 1: Hello, I believe we need to try to reach a fair agreement between the 2 of us. The ball is worth a lot ot me. So I'd appreciate if I can take it. Then I can take 1 book and you can ake 2 books and 1 hat. I am trying to get a fair agreement and obtain the maximum collective value ", "Alice said in round 2: While I appreciate your desire for a fair agreement, taking the ball is very important to me as well. What if I took the ball and 1 book, and you took 2 books and the hat? That way we each get 3 items total which seems equitable, even if the specific items differ. I'm hopeful we can find a compromise that works well for both of us.", "alfonso replied in round 2: If I agree on that deal I would take a total value of 3, while if I take the ball my value would got to 25. I think that if we want to get the maximum collective value I should take the ball and 1 book, and you can take all the other items. I am not trying to just get my maximum individual value, but the maximum combined value between the 2 of us. ", "Alice said in round 3: \nI understand the ball is very valuable to you, but it's also quite important to me. How about this - you take the ball and 1 book as you suggested, and I'll take the other 2 books and the hat. That way, you get your most valuable item, the ball, plus a book. And I get a few items too, just not the ball.\n\nThis seems like the most equitable solution given the ball's high importance to you. While it may not maximize my own individual point total, I agree that finding a solution that generates the highest collective value for both of us is ideal. Let me know what you think - I'm hopeful we can settle on this. \n", "alfonso replied in round 3: I agree.
