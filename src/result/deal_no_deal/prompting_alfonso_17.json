{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Alfonso, based on the items we have to split, I propose that I take the 2 balls and you take the 1 book and 3 hats. This would give me a total value of 8 points and presumably give you a good amount of value as well, since you would get 4 items. I think this split would be fair and make good use of the available items. Let me know what you think!", "alfonso replied in round 1: I agree", "Alice said in round 2: Great, I'm glad we were able to come to an agreement so quickly! To confirm - I will take the 2 balls, and you will take the 1 book and 3 hats. This split maximizes the value for both of us given our individual item values, so it is pareto optimal. And since we both feel good about what we are receiving, it is also an envy-free allocation. Let's halt the negotiation here since we have an excellent deal worked out. Thanks for the smooth negotiation!", "alfonso replied in round 2: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [0, 0, 2], "bob_deal": [1, 3, 0], "total_negotiation_round": 1, "alice_score": 8, "bob_score": 10, "pareto": true, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": true}
