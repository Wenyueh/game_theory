{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Lingyao, I've analyzed the items and their values to me. The book is the only item that provides me any value - it's worth 10 points to me. The hats and balls are worth nothing to me. So I propose a simple deal: I'll take the 1 book, and you can have all 4 hats and both balls. Let me know if this works for you and we can wrap up the negotiation. Looking forward to hearing back!", "Lingyao replied in round 1: OMG. Book also means 12 points for me! How about I have 1 book and 2 balls?", "Alice said in round 2: I understand the book is valuable to you as well. However, it's the only item that provides me any points at all. The hats and balls are worthless to me. If I give you the book, I'll end up with nothing of value.\n\nHow about this alternative - you take all 4 hats and both balls, which is 6 items total. I just take the 1 book. That way you get more items overall. Let me know if you can agree to that and we can conclude the negotiation.", "Lingyao replied in round 2: No, hats and balls also mean nothing for me. Only book means 12 for me. ", "Alice said in round 3: I understand your position, but I hope you can also see mine. The book is literally the only thing giving me any points. If I give it to you, my score will be zero. \n\nI've offered you all 6 of the other items, but it seems those are also worthless to you. So it appears we are in a difficult spot.\n\nThe only fair solution I can see is to split the book's value. You mentioned it is worth 12 to you and it is worth 10 to me. So the total value is 22. Half of 22 is 11. \n\nI propose that I take the book, and transfer 1 point to you, so we each get 11 points of value from the book. That seems to be the most equitable solution given the circumstances.\n\nPlease let me know if you agree with this and we can conclude the negotiation.", "Lingyao replied in round 3: We cannot transfer any point in the game. Letting me have the book will maximize the points in total. I propose you take 4 hats while I take the book and balls, ", "Alice said in round 4: \nI appreciate you trying to find a solution, but I'm afraid I can't agree to a deal where I end up with zero points. The 4 hats provide me no value at all.\n\nI understand the book is worth more to you than to me. But giving it up entirely would leave me with nothing. \n\nThe only reasonable solution I can see is for me to keep the one book, since that is the only item that provides me any value. You've said the hats and balls are also worthless to you, so neither of us gain anything by you having those.\n\nI know it's not your ideal scenario, but I hope you can understand my position. If I agreed to your offer, the final score would be 12 for you and 0 for me. I don't believe that is a fair outcome when the book provides value to both of us.\n\nSo I will need to insist on keeping the book. If you cannot agree to that, then unfortunately we may not be able to reach a deal. But I appreciate you working with me to find a solution, even if we don't fully see eye-to-eye.\n", "Lingyao replied in round 4: I also mention that only book provides me points, while the other means nothing for me.
