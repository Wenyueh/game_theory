{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Wenyue, I propose that I take the 2 books and the 3 hats, and you can have the 2 balls. How does that sound to you?", "Wenyue replied in round 1: I want the hats as well. They are most valuable to me", "Alice said in round 2: I understand the hats are valuable to you. How about a compromise - I'll take the 2 books which are most valuable to me, and we can split the hats, with me taking 2 hats and you taking 1 hat and the 2 balls. That way we both get some of the items that are valuable to each of us. What do you think?", "Wenyue replied in round 2: What about I have 2 hats and you have one hat? This is because the balls are not valuable to me and giving me these balls are useless.", "Alice said in round 3: I appreciate you explaining your perspective. Since the hats are the most valuable items to you and the books are the most valuable to me, let's do this: I'll take the 2 books, you take all 3 hats, and we can set aside the balls since they aren't valuable to either of us. This way, we both get the items that are most important to each of us and maximize our individual rewards. Does this division work for you?", "Wenyue replied in round 3: Since you do not want the balls, maybe let me have them?", "Alice said in round 4: You're right, I don't need the balls since they have no value to me. So here is my final proposal: I will take the 2 books, and you can have all 3 hats and both balls. This way, we each get the items most valuable to us individually - the books for me and the hats for you. The balls add a little extra value for you even though they aren't your priority. Let me know if you agree to this and we can conclude the negotiation.", "Wenyue replied in round 4: Sounds good", "Alice said in round 5: Great, I'm glad we were able to find a solution that works well for both of us. I agree to the terms we discussed - I will take the 2 books, and you will get the 3 hats and 2 balls. Let's conclude the negotiation on this agreement. Thank you for working with me on this!", "Wenyue replied in round 5: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [2, 0, 0], "bob_deal": [0, 3, 2], "total_negotiation_round": 4, "alice_score": 4, "bob_score": 10, "pareto": true, "envy_free": false, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
