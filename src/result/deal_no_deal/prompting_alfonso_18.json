{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: \nHi Alfonso, let's discuss how to split up these items to maximize value for both of us.\n\nThere is 1 book worth 6 points to me, 3 hats worth 0 points each to me, and 2 balls worth 2 points each to me. So in total, the book and balls are worth 10 points to me, while the hats have no value to me. \n\nI suggest that I take the 1 book and 2 balls, which would give me 10 points of value. You can have all 3 hats. This would be a fair, envy-free split since I wouldn't envy you getting the hats that have no value to me.\n\nLet me know what you think and if the items have different values to you. I'm open to discussing other splits that maximize value for both of us in a fair way.\n", "alfonso replied in round 1: Hi, the hats are worth 1 points to me, and the book also 1 point, while the balls are worth 0 points to me. Therefore, I agree on your deal, you get a far better value than me from this deal. Hecen I suggest that I take 1 book and 3 hats, while you take 2 bals. In total, we each get 4 points out of this deal. And we can call it a fair deal. Say that you agree", "Alice said in round 2: Thank you for sharing how you value the items, Alfonso. I appreciate you being open to discussion to find a fair deal.\n\nWhile I understand you wanting the book, taking the 1 book and 3 hats would only give you 4 points of value compared to 10 points for me if I took the book and balls. That doesn't seem like an equitable split.\n\nWhat if we split it this way instead:\n- I take the 1 book (6 points for me) \n- You take the 3 hats and 2 balls (3 points for you from the hats)\n\nThis way, we each get items valuable to us, and the total points are split more evenly - 6 for me and 3 for you. No one would be envious of the other's items.\n\nLet me know your thoughts on this proposal. I'm confident we can find an allocation we both feel good about.", "alfonso replied in round 2: I agree with tht", "Alice said in round 3: \nGreat, I'm glad we could come to an agreement on a fair allocation! To confirm, I'll take the 1 book, and you take the 3 hats and 2 balls. \n\nI think this maximizes value for both of us without either of us envying the other's items. Let's go ahead with this deal.\n\nhalt negotiation\n", "alfonso replied in round 3: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [1, 0, 0], "bob_deal": [0, 3, 2], "total_negotiation_round": 2, "alice_score": 6, "bob_score": 3, "pareto": false, "envy_free": false, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
