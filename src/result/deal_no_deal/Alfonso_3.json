{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Alfonso, thanks for negotiating with me. I noticed the 2 balls are the most valuable items, worth 3 points each to me. Would you be willing to let me have the 2 balls, and in exchange you can have the 3 books and the hat? That would be a 6 to 4 point split in my favor, but you'd get more items. Let me know what you think!", "Alfonso replied in round 1: Hello, the 2 balls are also the most valuable items to. We should each take 1 ball, you can take all the books and I will take the hat. That is the most fair deal to all of us", "Alice said in round 2: I appreciate you wanting to split things fairly Alfonso, but taking one ball each would give you 5 total points (3 for the ball and 2 for the hat) while I would only get 4 points (3 for my ball and 1 for the books). How about this - you take the hat and 2 of the books, and I'll take the 2 balls and the remaining book. That way we each get 6 points worth of value. Would you agree to that?", "Alfonso replied in round 2: We don't have the same values for items. To me the books have no value. I think w I think we need to split it so we both have the maximum possible value. So 1 ball each, you take all the books and I take the hat. I truly believe this is the best split", "Alice said in round 3: I understand the books have no value to you, but they do have some value to me, even if less than the balls. How about we compromise - you take 1 ball and the hat, which gets you 5 points. And I'll take 1 ball and all 3 books. That gets me 6 points, just 1 more than you. I think that's a reasonable trade-off since the books have at least some value to me but none to you. If you agree, we both walk away with a good amount of points. What do you say?", "Alfonso replied in round 3: Yes", "Alice said in round 4: Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement that works well for both of us. I accept the deal - I'll take 1 ball and the 3 books, and you take the other ball and the hat. Thanks for the productive negotiation!\n\nhalt negotiation", "Alfonso replied in round 4: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [3, 0, 1], "bob_deal": [0, 1, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 3, "alice_score": 6, "bob_score": 6, "pareto": true, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": true}
