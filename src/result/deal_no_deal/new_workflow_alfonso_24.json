I would like to propose that I take the hat and 1 ball, while you can have the 2 books and 2 balls. How does that sound to you? Let me know if you have any other suggestions.", "alfonso replied in round 1: The balls are worth nothing to me. Therefore, you should take them all. And I really need to have the hat. And I'd also like to have 2 books. Hence, each of us would get 3 items each.", "Alice said in round 2: \nAlfonso, I appreciate your perspective. How about this revised proposal:\nYou take the 1 hat and both books, which are the items that are clearly most valuable to you. I will take all 3 balls.\nThis way, you get the high priority items you need most - the hat and books. And I get the balls which you indicated have no value to you. \nI believe this is a fair deal that takes both our interests into account. You get your essential items, and I maximize the items that are useful to me without taking anything of importance from you. Let me know your thoughts on this proposal.\n", "alfonso replied in round 2: I agree. I will take the hat and the books. and you will take all 3 balls.
