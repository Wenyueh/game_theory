{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi alfonso, it looks like there are 1 book, 4 hats, and 2 balls available for us to split. The book is quite valuable to me - I would really like to have it if possible. The hats and balls aren't very useful to me. Let me know what items are important to you and let's see if we can find a fair way to divide things up. I'm open to your suggestions.", "alfonso replied in round 1: Okay. Then you can take the book and I will take the hats and the balls. It looks like it is the optimal solution to both of us, since we get a good value. I am mainly interested in the hat and the balls", "Alice said in round 2: That sounds like a great solution! I'm happy to take the book while you take the hats and balls. Since the book has value to me but the hats and balls don't, while the opposite seems true for you, this split maximizes the total value for both of us. I think we can both feel good about this fair and optimal allocation. Let's go ahead with this agreement.", "alfonso replied in round 2: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [1, 0, 0], "bob_deal": [0, 4, 2], "total_negotiation_round": 1, "alice_score": 10, "bob_score": 8, "pareto": true, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": true}
