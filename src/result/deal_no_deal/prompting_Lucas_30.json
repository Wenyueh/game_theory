I don't know how much you value each item, but I think it's important we try to find an allocation that we both feel is fair and leaves neither of us envying what the other gets. Do you have any initial thoughts on how we could split the items?", "Lucas replied in round 1: I think I should take the ball and you should take everything else. It's a fair split.", "Alice said in round 2: Thanks for the proposal Lucas. However, taking all the books plus the hat would leave me with more total items than you. I want us to have a balanced and fair split. \n\nHow about this alternative - I take the 1 hat, and you take the 3 books and 1 ball. That way, we each get multiple items and the distribution is more even. I think this allocation could work well for both of us.\n\nLet me know what you think of this idea and if you have any other suggestions.", "Lucas replied in round 2: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [0, 0, 0], "bob_deal": [3, 0, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 1, "alice_score": 0, "bob_score": 9, "pareto": false, "envy_free": false, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
