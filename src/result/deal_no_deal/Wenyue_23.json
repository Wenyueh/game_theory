{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Wenyue, it's nice to negotiate with you. I think a fair split would be for me to take the 1 hat and 2 balls, while you take the 2 books and 1 ball. That way we each get 3 items. What do you think?", "Wenyue replied in round 1: The ball and hats are very valuable to me. Since they are also valuable to you, what abuot I take the hat, and you take the 2 balls? Then we can split the books evenly", "Alice said in round 2: Thanks for your proposal Wenyue. While I appreciate you offering to split the books evenly, the hat is quite valuable to me. What if I took the hat and 1 ball, and you took the other 2 balls and both books? That would give each of us 3 items still, but allow me to get the hat which I really want. Let me know what you think.", "Wenyue replied in round 2: The hat is the most valuable item to me. If I cannot obtain it, I will break the negotiation and neither of us will obtain anything", "Alice said in round 3: I understand the hat is very important to you Wenyue. While I would have liked to obtain it myself, I am willing to let you have the hat in order to reach an agreement. \nHowever, since I am giving up the valuable hat, I propose that in exchange I take all 3 balls and you can have both books in addition to the hat. This would give you 3 total items and me 3 items as well. \nPlease let me know if you can agree to this, as I would like us both to get something out of this negotiation rather than nothing at all.", "Wenyue replied in round 3: Yes, sounds good", "Alice said in round 4: Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement. To confirm, I will take all 3 balls and you will take the hat and both books. Let's halt the negotiation here so we can each claim our items. It was a pleasure negotiating with you Wenyue.", "Wenyue replied in round 4: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [0, 0, 3], "bob_deal": [2, 1, 0], "total_negotiation_round": 3, "alice_score": 6, "bob_score": 10, "pareto": true, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": true}
