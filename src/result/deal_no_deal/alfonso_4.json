{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Alfonso, it looks like we have 6 items to divide between us - 3 books, 1 hat and 2 balls. I propose we each take 1 book, and then you take the hat and I'll take the 2 balls. That would give us each 3 items. How does that sound to you?", "alfonso replied in round 1: Hi Alice. Very nice to meet you. The books are worth nothing to me. So you can take them all. That will give you 3 items. I will take the hat. And I should take the remaining 2 balls so I can hvae 3 items in total. This should give booth of us 3 items with the highest value for each of us", "Alice said in round 2: Thanks for your proposal Alfonso, but I'm afraid I can't agree to that split. The books are worth a lot more to me (2 points each) compared to the balls (only 1 point each). So if I took the 3 books and you took the hat and 2 balls, that would give me 6 points worth of items and you only 2 points worth, which doesn't seem very fair. \n\nI'd like to find a more balanced solution. What if I took 2 of the books and 1 ball (for 5 points) and you took the remaining book, the hat and 1 ball (for 3 points)? That way we both get a good mix of higher and lower value items. Let me know what you think!", "alfonso replied in round 2: Agree", "Alice said in round 3: Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement that works well for both of us. To confirm - I will take 2 books and 1 ball, and you will take 1 book, the hat and 1 ball. If you're good with that, let's conclude our negotiation. Thanks for working with me on this Alfonso!", "alfonso replied in round 3: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [2, 0, 1], "bob_deal": [1, 1, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 2, "alice_score": 5, "bob_score": 9, "pareto": false, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
