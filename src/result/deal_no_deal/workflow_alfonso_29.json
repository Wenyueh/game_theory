{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi alfonso, it looks like we have 2 books, 2 hats, and 1 ball to divide between us. I'm hoping we can find a fair split that we're both satisfied with. To start, I would propose that I take the ball and 1 book, and you can have the other book and the 2 hats. Let me know what you think of that as a starting point for discussion.", "Bob replied in round 1: I'd suggest that I take the ball. I really need the ball. And I can then take 1 book or hat. You can take the remaining 3 items. You will end up with 3 items, while I only have 2. But let me have the ball.", "Alice said in round 2: \nalfonso, I hear that the ball is very important to you and you value it highly. I want to make sure you get the item that matters most to you.\n\nHow about this - you take the ball, 1 book, and both hats. I will take just the other book. \n\nThis way, you get the high-value ball plus 3 other items. I get less total items, but I'm okay with that because I know the ball is the key item for you.\n\nI believe this division considers both our interests and puts the ball, the most important item, in your hands. It's less balanced in terms of number of items, but aims for a fair division of overall value.\n\nLet me know if you would agree to this split. I want to make sure we find an allocation we both feel good about.\n", "Bob replied in round 2: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [1, 0, 0], "bob_deal": [1, 2, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 1, "alice_score": 1, "bob_score": 9, "pareto": true, "envy_free": false, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false, "guessed_bob_value_rank": "ball > book > hat", "actual_bob_value_rank": "ball > book = hat", "guessed_bob_relative_value": "\nItems Alfonso values higher than you: ball\nItems Alfonso values the same as you: book\nItems Alfonso values less than you: hat\n", "actual_bob_relative_value": ["equal to you: book", "higher than you: hat", "less than you: ball"]}
