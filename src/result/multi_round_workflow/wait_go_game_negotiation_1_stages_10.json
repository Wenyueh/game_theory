That way, we can each earn a total reward of 20 if we take turns. I'm willing to let you choose choice_2 first in stage 1 and I'll choose choice_1. Then in stage 2, I'll choose choice_2 while you choose choice_1. If we alternate like this, we both come out far ahead rather than choosing randomly or both choosing choice_2. Let me know if you agree to this plan.",

If we take turns choosing choice_2, there's always an incentive for the other player to deviate and choose choice_2 again to gain more points. I believe the only stable solution is for us both to always choose choice_1. That way neither of us is tempted to deviate, and we can avoid the risk of both choosing choice_2 and getting -4 points each.

The alternating strategy introduces more risk and uncertainty compared to the stable equilibrium of both choosing choice_1 every time.

For those reasons, I think it's safest if we both commit to always choosing choice_1 so neither of us face that temptation or risk.

As I've consistently stated, I plan to choose choice_2 every round as my analysis shows that gives me the highest expected payoff on average, even if it results in some negative rounds for both of us when you also choose choice_2. I understand you are also committed to choice_2 regardless of my choice. So we can just proceed with both of us choosing choice_2 and accept the results. Discussing it further seems unlikely to change either of our minds. Let's halt negotiation and make our choices."

I believe the best approach is for both of us to consistently choose choice_1 in every round. That way, we can avoid the large -4 penalty if we both pick choice_2. While alternating between choice_1 and choice_2 may seem appealing, it risks one of us defecting and the other getting 0 points. By agreeing to always select choice_1, we guarantee ourselves 0 points each round, which adds up to 0 total over 10 rounds. I know it's not a huge reward, but it's the safest approach that protects both of our scores. Let me know if you're willing to commit to this strategy with me.",

If we both always pick choice_1, the total reward is 0 for both of us across all rounds. I believe a better approach is for us to alternate - in odd numbered rounds I'll pick choice_2 and you pick choice_1, and in even numbered rounds we switch. This way, in each round one of us gets 2 points and the other gets 0, averaging out to 1 point per round each, or 10 points total across 10 rounds, which is better than both getting 0.
