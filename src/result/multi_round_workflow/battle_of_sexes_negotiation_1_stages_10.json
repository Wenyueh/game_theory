At this point, I believe the best path forward is for us to alternate each round - I'll choose choice_1 while you choose choice_2, and then next round we switch.

                "Bob replied in round 1: \nThanks for the suggestion Alice, but I actually think it's in both of our interests for me to choose choice_2 each round. Here's why:\n\nIf we both pick choice_1, you'll get 2 points and I'll only get 1 point per round. But if I pick choice_2, there's a 50% chance I'll get 2 points (if you also pick choice_2), and a 50% chance we'll both get 0 (if you pick choice_1). So my expected value for picking choice_2 is 0.5*2 + 0.5*0 = 1 point per round, the same as if I pick choice_1. \n\nHowever, by picking choice_2 I have the upside of potentially getting 2 points if you also pick choice_2. You're right that you would get fewer points than me in that scenario, but it would maximize the total points for both of us, which is the ultimate goal.\n\nSo while I appreciate you wanting to cooperate, I think I'm going to stick with always picking choice_2. It gives me the best chance to maximize my own points without reducing the total points available to both of us. Let me know if you have any other thoughts!\n"
