{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Lingyao, there are 5 items total - 3 books, 1 hat, and 1 ball. Since there are two of us, I propose that we split the items evenly to be fair. I'm happy to take the hat and 1 book, and you can have the ball and 2 books. How does that sound to you?", "Lingyao replied in round 1: Agree. I will take the ball and 2 books. Let's halt negotiation", "Alice said in round 2: \nI appreciate your offer, but I don't think it would be an even split in terms of item values. The hat is quite valuable to me.\n\nI propose that I take the 1 hat and 1 ball, while you take all 3 books. That way we each get 2 items and the division should be more equitable in terms of each of our valuations.\n\nLet me know if this works for you or if you have any other ideas. I'm confident we can find an allocation we're both satisfied with.\n", "Lingyao replied in round 2: Hey, that is what you propose. \"I'm happy to take the hat and 1 book, and you can have the ball and 2 books.\" This is what you said in the first round. I agree with your propose. ", "Alice said in round 3: \nYou're right Lingyao, I apologize for the confusion. In my initial proposal, I did suggest that I take the hat and 1 book while you take the ball and 2 books. \n\nUpon further reflection, I believe this split would be fair and equitable for both of us. The hat is quite valuable to me, so receiving that along with 1 book should balance out with you receiving the ball and 2 books. This allocation gives us each a high value item (the hat for me, the ball for you) and divides the books between us.\n\nIf you're still agreeable to this plan - I take the hat and 1 book, you take the ball and 2 books - then I'm happy to finalize our agreement. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with halting the negotiation on these terms. I appreciate your flexibility and fairness in this discussion.\n", "Lingyao replied in round 3: I agree. I will take the ball and 2 books, while you take the hat and 1 book. ", "Alice said in round 4: Excellent, I'm glad we could come to an agreement that seems fair for both of us. To confirm, I will take the 1 hat and 1 book, while you take the 1 ball and 2 books. If you're satisfied with this allocation, then I'm happy to halt the negotiation. \n\nThank you for the productive discussion and your willingness to find a mutually beneficial solution. I believe this deal is both pareto optimal and envy free based on our preferences. Please confirm you're ready to halt, and we can conclude the negotiation.", "Lingyao replied in round 4: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [1, 1, 0], "bob_deal": [2, 0, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 3, "alice_score": 9, "bob_score": 8, "pareto": false, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
