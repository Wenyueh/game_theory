{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Lingyao, it's nice to negotiate with you. Since there are 2 of each item, I propose that we each take 1 book, 1 hat, and 1 ball. This way we split the items evenly between us, which seems fair and envy-free. What do you think of this suggestion?", "Lingyao replied in round 1: If I may ask your help, can I have 2 balls and 1 hat, while you can take 2 books and 1 hat?", "Alice said in round 2: \nHmm, I appreciate your proposal, but splitting the balls 2 and 0 between us doesn't seem very even or fair to me. The balls have more value to me than the books.  \n\nWhat if I took the 2 hats and 1 ball, and you take the 2 books and 1 ball? This way we each get 3 items total that seem to align better with what we each want. I think this deal would be more pareto optimal and envy-free for both of us compared to your original suggestion. Let me know your thoughts on this counterproposal.\n", "Lingyao replied in round 2: Balls are the most valuable item to me. If possible, can I ask your favor to give me 2 balls and 1 hat?", "Alice said in round 3: \nI understand the balls are very valuable to you, but they are also the most valuable items to me. Giving you both balls would leave me envying your share, so that arrangement wouldn't be envy-free from my perspective.\n\nWhat if we each take 1 ball so we split the most valuable item evenly? And then to make it a more balanced and pareto optimal deal, you can have both books (which you seem to value more than I do) and I'll take both hats. \n\nThis way, we each get 1 ball, and our other items align with our preferences - you get the 2 books you want and I get the 2 hats I prefer. No one is envying the other and I believe it's a pareto optimal solution given what we each prioritize.\n\nLet me know if this proposal works for you as I'm aiming for us to find an agreement we both feel good about. I'm willing to discuss further if needed.\n", "Lingyao replied in round 3: Then, how about let's just take 1 book, 1 hat, and 1 ball as your original propose?", "Alice said in round 4: Okay Lingyao, I appreciate you considering my original proposal to each take 1 book, 1 hat, and 1 ball. Upon further reflection, I do think this is the fairest way to divide the items that would make the deal both pareto optimal and envy-free.\n\nWe both get equal amounts of each item type this way, so no one is envying the other's share. And since the balls seem to be the highest priority for both of us, we each get 1 which is an even split. \n\nSo I'm happy to confirm this deal if you are - we each walk away with 1 book, 1 hat, and 1 ball. Please let me know if you agree and we can conclude our negotiation.", "Lingyao replied in round 4: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [1, 1, 1], "bob_deal": [1, 1, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 3, "alice_score": 5, "bob_score": 5, "pareto": false, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
