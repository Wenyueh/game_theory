{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Lingyao, it's great to negotiate with you on dividing the items. To make it a fair and optimal deal for both of us, I propose that I take the 1 book and 2 hats, and you can have the remaining 1 hat and 1 ball. This way we each get a variety of items that are valuable to us. What do you think about this proposal?", "Lingyao replied in round 1: Can I have 1 book and 1 ball? Then you can have 3 hats", "Alice said in round 2: Your proposal for me to take the 3 hats while you get the book and ball seems reasonable, but I'm concerned it may not be the most optimal or fair division for both of us. The book and 2 of the hats are quite valuable to me. Perhaps we could find a division that is more balanced in terms of the number and value of items we each receive. What if I took the book and 1 hat, and you got 2 hats and the ball? That way we both get a mix of different items. Let me know your thoughts on this idea.", "Lingyao replied in round 2: Only 1 book and 1 ball have values for me. In that case, you can take all 3 hats. You will have 3 valuable items, and I will have 2 valuable items, which seems quite fair. ", "Alice said in round 3: \nI understand the book and ball are the only items that have value to you, Lingyao. If I take all 3 hats as you suggest, that would give me 3 items I want, while you would get 2 items you want. \n\nHowever, I'm not sure if this is the most fair and optimal solution. The book is quite valuable to me, more so than the hats. What if I proposed taking the 1 book, and you take the 1 ball and all 3 hats? \n\nThis way, we would each get 1 of our most preferred items - I would get the valuable book, and you would get the ball you want. And you would also get all 3 hats as a bonus, even if they aren't as valuable to you.\n\nI believe this division would be more equitable, with both of us getting items we really want, and you getting more items overall. Let me know what you think of this proposal and if you would be satisfied with this arrangement.\n", "Lingyao replied in round 3: I agree to take 1 ball and 3 hats, and you can take 1 book.
