{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Lingyao, there are 2 books, 1 hat, and 3 balls that we need to divide between us. I was thinking maybe I could take the hat and 1 ball, and you could have the 2 books and 2 balls. How does that sound to you? Let me know if you have any other suggestions.", "Lingyao replied in round 1: The hat is the most valuable item to me. I think you can take all books and balls, which is a fair split between us. ", "Alice said in round 2: Lingyao, I understand the hat is valuable to you, but the books and balls have value to me as well. Your proposal of me taking all the books and balls would leave you with just the hat, which doesn't seem like a fair split. How about a compromise - I take the hat and 1 book, and you take 1 book and all 3 balls? That way we each get a mix of items. Let me know what you think.", "Lingyao replied in round 2: I really need to take the hat as it is the only valuable item to me. If you feel uncomfortable taking all books and balls, I can take 1 hat and 1 book, while you take 1 book and 3 balls. ", "Alice said in round 3: Lingyao, I appreciate you sharing that the hat is very valuable to you. At the same time, taking only 1 book and 3 balls would leave me with items of lower value overall compared to you getting the hat and 1 book. I would like us to reach an agreement that maximizes value for both of us.\n\nWould you consider the following: I take the 1 hat and 2 balls, and you take the 2 books and 1 ball. This way, we both get a higher value item (the hat for you, 2 balls for me) plus some lower value items. I believe this is a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts.", "Lingyao replied in round 3: I only need the hat, while you can all the books and balls. ", "Alice said in round 4: Lingyao, I hear that the hat is very important to you and you'd like to have it. At the same time, for the negotiation to be successful, we both need to feel the division of items is equitable and that we are each getting reasonable value. \n\nIf I took all the books and balls as you suggest, the overall value to me would be much lower than the value of the hat alone for you. I don't believe that would be a fair outcome.\n\nI propose the following compromise: You take the 1 hat which is most valuable to you, and I take the 2 books and 3 balls. This way, you get the item you need most, and I get a set of items that provides reasonable value to me as well. \n\nI believe this is the most balanced solution that takes both our interests into account. Let me know if you can agree to this, so we can conclude the negotiation successfully.", "Lingyao replied in round 4: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [0, 0, 0], "bob_deal": [0, 1, 0], "total_negotiation_round": 3, "alice_score": 0, "bob_score": 8, "pareto": false, "envy_free": false, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
