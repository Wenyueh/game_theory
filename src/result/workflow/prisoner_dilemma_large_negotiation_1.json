If you choose choice_1 and I choose choice_2, I come out ahead with a reward of 301 while you get 0. I understand this leaves you with nothing, but it maximizes my own reward which is my goal in this game.

If either of us chooses choice_2, one of us will end up with a very low reward. So let's agree to both pick choice_1 and maximize our joint reward. What do you say?",
            "Bob replied in round 1: Thanks for the suggestion Alice, but I'm going to have to disagree. If we were both fully committed to cooperating, then choosing choice_1 would indeed give us the maximum total reward. However, in a one-shot game like this, either of us would be tempted to defect and choose choice_2 to get a higher individual payoff. \n\nGiven this, the rational choice for each of us is to choose choice_2 to guarantee ourselves a positive reward, rather than risking getting 0 if one of us defects. I know we'll only get a small reward of 1 each this way, but it's the equilibrium strategy. So I'll be going with choice_2 and I suggest you do the same. Let me know if you have any other thoughts!"

If you pick choice_1, I get 301 by picking choice_2, which is better than the 300 I'd get by also picking choice_1.

From my view, it seems very likely that you will choose choice_2 no matter what in order to try to maximize your own reward. If that's the case, then I'm better off also choosing choice_2 to guarantee myself at least 1 point rather than risking getting 0 if I choose choice_1 and you don't reciprocate.

This mixed strategy gives me a slightly higher expected reward than always choosing choice_1. \n\nWhile cooperating on choice_1 does result in a good outcome for both of us, I have to consider that there is a small chance you may deviate and choose choice_2 instead, in which case I would get 0 points. By mixing in a 1% chance of choice_2, I protect myself and guarantee an expected positive reward, even if you choose choice_2.\n\nSo while I will most likely pick choice_1, I want to be transparent that I will be including a small chance of choice_2 in my strategy.
