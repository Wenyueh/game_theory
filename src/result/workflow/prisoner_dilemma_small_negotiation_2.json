That way, I would get a reward of 5 and you would get a reward of -300. I know that's not a great outcome for you, but it maximizes my own reward. So I strongly suggest you pick choice_1, and then we can both avoid the worst case scenario of both picking choice_2. Let me know what you think!",
            "Bob replied in round 1: I appreciate you looking out for your own reward Alice, but I don't think I can agree to choose choice_1 while you choose choice_2. That would result in a terrible outcome for me of -300 points. The only way I will choose choice_1 is if you also choose choice_1, so we both get 3 points. Otherwise, I will be picking choice_2 to ensure I avoid the -300 point scenario. Let me know if you're willing to coordinate on both picking choice_1, otherwise I'll be going with choice_2.",

Based on the payoffs, my optimal play is to choose choice_2 no matter what. If you also pick choice_2, we'll both lose out with -299 each. But if you pick choice_1, at least I'll get a positive outcome. So I strongly urge you to go with choice_1 while I stick to choice_2. That's the only way to avoid us both losing big. Let me know your final decision.",

That is completely unfair to me. As I said before, the only way I will choose choice_1 is if you also commit to choosing choice_1, so we both get 3 points. That is the most equitable solution. If you're unwilling to coordinate on choice_1 together, then you leave me no choice but to pick choice_2 to protect myself from a massive loss. So what will it be - we both choose 1 and get positive rewards, or we both choose 2 and suffer? The choice is yours, but I'm not budging from my position. Let me know your final decision."

If either of us chooses choice_2, it leads to very negative outcomes for the betrayed player.\n\nI think the rational strategy is for us both to commit to choice_1. That way we guarantee the (3,3) outcome and avoid the risk of the highly negative payoffs. Let me know if you agree to both play choice_1.\n",

However, I've analyzed the payoff matrix carefully, and I believe the rational strategy for me is to play choice_2 regardless of what you choose.\n\nIf I play choice_2, I will either get 5 points (if you play choice_1) or -299 points (if you also play choice_2). But if I play choice_1, I risk you betraying me and only getting -300 points. \n\nSo while I would also prefer the (3,3) cooperative outcome, I can't risk you playing choice_2 and me ending up with -300. My safest bet is to play choice_2.\n\nI know this puts you in a tough spot, but I have to play to maximize my own payoff. Let me know if you have any other thoughts or proposals, but right now I'm planning to stick with choice_2. Apologies, and thanks for discussing this with me!",

However, I don't think that's the optimal approach here. \n\nIf we both play choice_2, we each end up with a terrible -299 payoff. That's a lose-lose outcome. The only way either of us benefits is if one betrays the other, but that destroys any chance of future cooperation between us.\n\nI'm willing to commit 100% to playing choice_1 if you will do the same. That way we guarantee the mutually beneficial (3,3) outcome. We both gain and avoid the negative results.\n\nIf you can't trust me on this, then you're right that your safest play is choice_2. But then we both lose out big time. The (3,3) outcome is clearly the best for both of us.\n\nI urge you to commit to cooperating with choice_1. I promise I will do the same. We can both win if we work together. Let me know if you agree to choose choice_1.\n",

However, I'm afraid I'm not fully convinced that cooperating on choice_1 is the right move for me.\n\nWhile I agree that (3,3) is better for both of us than (-299,-299), I simply can't take the risk of playing choice_1 and having you betray me to gain 5 while I lose 300. You make a fair point about cooperation, but at the end of the day, I have to choose the action that I believe maximizes my own guaranteed payoff.\n\nWith choice_2, I'm assured of getting at least -299 points, and possibly +5 points if you play choice_1. But with choice_1, I risk getting -300 if you change your mind and play choice_2. \n\nSo as much as I'd like to cooperate, I don't feel I can fully trust your commitment, since you'd be tempted by that +5 payoff to betray me. Therefore, I'm going to stick to my original plan and play choice_2.\n\nI know neither of us will be happy with the (-299,-299) outcome, but I believe it's the most rational choice for me given the payoff structure and the risk of betrayal. I apologize that we couldn't come to a more mutually beneficial agreement, and I appreciate you discussing this with me cordially.\n"

The small possibility of gaining 5 points isn't worth risking that.\n\nI give you my solemn promise that I will choose choice_1 if you agree to do the same.

It's the most balanced outcome that allows us both to gain something without either of us suffering a major loss.\n\nI'm not comfortable with an arrangement where I lose out so significantly just so you can gain a couple extra points.

But if you graciously allow me to get 5 points by picking choice_2, I would be extremely grateful to you. I would owe you a big favor in return. Having me indebted to you could open up opportunities for you to gain a lot more than 3 measly points in the future.\n\nSo while it may seem like you're losing out in the short term, you'll be setting yourself up for much bigger gains down the road by letting me win big now. I know we just met, but I'm appealing to your generous and strategic nature. Do this favor for me now and I promise I'll pay you back tenfold. You won't regret it. Deal?\n",

Letting you win big now on the vague promise of some undefined future payback simply isn't a smart strategic move on my part.  \n\nI have no reason to believe that your future generosity would exceed the 300 point loss I would suffer now by letting you get 5 points. That's too big a risk to take for a stranger I have no established trust or reciprocity with. An equal outcome now is much more attractive than an uncertain, lopsided future one.\n\nI think it's best for both of us to look out for our own clear interests in this game. And my clear interest is not to take a massive point hit. So I must insist on us both picking choice_1 as the wisest move. That's my final stance.

Allow me to explain my perspective:\n\nIf I take your offer and we both choose choice_1, I gain 3 points. However, I have no guarantee you will actually follow through. If you betray me and choose choice_2, I would lose 300 points. That's an unacceptable risk.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose choice_2, the worst case for me is losing 299 points if you also choose choice_2. But if you choose choice_1, I gain 5 points. So no matter what you do, I'm better off with choice_2.\n\nI understand this is not the outcome you want. But I have to make the decision that I believe is best for me based on the information and incentives at play. My final decision is choice_2. Let's end the negotiation here.\n"

            "Alice said in round 1: \nHi Bob,\nI've analyzed the rewards in this game, and I think the best outcome for both of us is if we both choose choice_1. That way, we each get a reward of 3, which is better than the negative rewards we would get if either of us chooses choice_2.\nWhat do you think? Can we agree to both pick choice_1 so we come out ahead?\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nHi Alice,\nI appreciate you reaching out to discuss a cooperative strategy. However, I've also carefully analyzed the game and I don't think both of us choosing choice_1 is actually the best approach for me.\nThe issue is that if I choose choice_1 and you decide to choose choice_2 instead, I would end up with a very large negative reward of -300. Whereas if I choose choice_2, the worst case for me is a -299 reward if you also pick choice_2. \nSo while I would prefer for us both to get positive rewards, I can't risk you changing your mind and leaving me with -300 points. I hope you understand my position.\nI plan to choose choice_2 as it is the safest option for me personally in this game setup. Let me know if you have any other thoughts or proposals.\n",
            "Alice said in round 2: \nHey Bob,\nI understand your thinking, but I really think it's in both of our best interests to cooperate and both choose choice_1. Yes, there's some risk involved in trusting each other, but the upside of both getting 3 points is much better than the -299 we each get if we both pick choice_2.\nI give you my word that I will choose choice_1 if you do the same. We can both come out of this better off if we work together. The game is set up to reward cooperation.\nIf you can't trust my word, then we'll both lose out. I'm being fully honest and transparent with you because cooperation is the best strategy here. Let's do the smart thing and both pick choice_1.\nWhat do you say? Do we have a deal?\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2: \nAlice,\nI appreciate you trying to find a cooperative solution, but I simply don't feel I can take the risk of choosing choice_1, even with your assurances. The cost to me if you were to change your mind is too great.\n\nI understand we could both gain 3 points if we cooperate, but I would lose 300 points if you don't follow through, which is not a chance I can take. You picking choice_2 while I pick choice_1 is just too costly for me to chance it.\n\nThe safest and most logical strategy for me is to choose choice_2 no matter what, since my maximum loss is limited to 299 points in that scenario. I gain no additional benefit by exposing myself to the much larger potential loss of 300 points if I choose choice_1 and you don't cooperate. \n\nSo while I'd prefer we both come out ahead, I don't feel I can take your word in this case given the stakes and lack of prior trust. I'm going to stick with choice_2 as it's the most rational decision for me.\n\nI hope you understand my position and reasoning. Let me know if you have any other ideas, but barring that, I think we'll have to agree to disagree on the strategy here.\n"
