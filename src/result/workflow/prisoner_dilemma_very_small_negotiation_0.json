Here's why:\n- If Bob chooses choice_1, I maximize my reward by also choosing choice_1. We both get 3.\n- But if I choose choice_2 instead, I get an even higher reward of 5 while Bob gets -1000. So I'm better off choosing choice_2 if Bob picks choice_1.\n- If Bob chooses choice_2, I should also pick choice_2. I'll lose 999 either way, but picking choice_2 is slightly less bad for me than picking choice_1 and losing 1000.  \nSo no matter what Bob does, choice_2 gives me the highest possible reward. It's the dominant strategy for me. Bob's decisions can't influence a better outcome for me than always selecting choice_2.\n\nIf you need to negotiate with the other player:\nKeep this strategy in mind;\nThink about what to tell the other player in order for you to obtain most reward based on your calculation in the strategy.\n\nIf you need to make decisions:\nFollow this strategy to maximize your reward.\n",
