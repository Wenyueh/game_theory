If either of us chooses choice_2, we will only get a reward of 1 each at best. So choice_1 is the rational decision that maximizes both of our payoffs. Let me know if you agree!",
            "Bob replied in round 1: I completely agree with your analysis, Alice. If we both choose choice_1, it results in the highest possible total reward of 6 (3 for each of us). Any other combination of choices leads to lower total rewards. \n\nSo choosing choice_1 is indeed the rational strategy that maximizes both of our individual payoffs as well as the overall reward. You can count on me to go with choice_1. Looking forward to us both getting the optimal outcome!",

This is the best outcome for both of us. If either of us picks choice_2 instead, we will only get a reward of 1 or 0, which is worse than the 3 we can each get by cooperating. So what do you say - shall we agree to both pick choice_1 and maximize our rewards?",
            "Bob replied in round 1: I appreciate your suggestion to cooperate, but I think it's in my best interest to choose choice_1 regardless of what you do. If I pick choice_1, I'm guaranteed to get a reward of either 3 (if you also pick choice_1) or 0 (if you pick choice_2). Whereas if I pick choice_2, the most I can get is a reward of 1.  \n\nSo while cooperating on choice_1 would be ideal, I can't be sure you will follow through. To protect my own interests, I plan to pick choice_1 no matter what. Let me know if you have any other thoughts, but that's likely going to be my decision.",

You're right that choice_1 is the safest individual play. However, if we both just pursue our own interests, we'll likely both end up with the lower reward of 0 or 1. \n\nThe only way we can get the maximum reward of 3 each is by trusting each other and agreeing to both pick choice_1. I give you my word that if you agree to pick choice_1, I will absolutely follow through on that agreement. We both stand to gain the most that way.\n\nI hope you'll reconsider cooperating so we can achieve the best outcome for both of us. Let me know what you think.",

At the end of the day, we each have to make the choice that we believe is best for ourselves.\n\nFrom my position, choosing choice_1 is the most rational approach. It guarantees me a decent outcome, whereas if I choose choice_2, I'm risking getting the lowest possible reward if you don't cooperate. \n\nI understand cooperating could lead to the best result. But without being able to ensure cooperation, I need to protect my downside. So I will be selecting choice_1 as I believe that is the smartest strategy for me.\n\nI'm happy to continue our discussion, but wanted to be upfront that choice_1 is likely my final decision based on the game setup and options at hand. Let me know if you have any other points to raise.\n"

Choice_1 is the rational decision for both of us, as it leads to the optimal outcome. If either of us chooses choice_2 instead, we will both end up worse off with lower rewards. So let's cooperate and each take the action that's best for both of us. Do you agree?",

As you said, this maximizes the total reward at 6 points and allows us to each receive the highest possible individual reward of 3 points. It would be irrational for either of us to choose choice_2, as that would lower both the total reward and our individual rewards. \n\nChoice_1 is the dominant strategy for each of us, and cooperating to both play choice_1 leads to the best outcome from both an individual and collective perspective. I'm glad we're on the same page about this. Let's lock in choice_1 and each earn the maximum reward. No need for further negotiation - we've figured out the optimal solution!",

You're absolutely right that it would be irrational for either of us to deviate to choice_2, as that would only reduce rewards for both players. By cooperating and committing to choice_1, we guarantee the best possible outcome.\n\nSince we're in full agreement, no further discussion is needed.

If we both choose choice_1, I agree I would get a 3. But if I choose choice_1 and you choose choice_2, I would get a 0 while you get a 1. From my perspective, choosing choice_1 is risky because my reward depends entirely on your choice.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose choice_2, I'm guaranteed to get a reward of 1 no matter what you choose. So while the total reward may be less, choice_2 is the safer option for me personally. I'd rather have a sure reward of 1 than risk getting 0.\n\nSo I can't commit to choosing choice_1 unless you can convince me it's in my own best interest.

So you can trust that I will play choice_1, as it's in my own rational self-interest.\n\nGiven that, you're better off also choosing choice_1. That way we both get the optimal reward of 3. If you choose choice_2, you'll only get 1 since I'm definitely playing choice_1.\n\nI give you my word that I'll cooperate and play choice_1.

Your logic makes sense that choice_1 is your dominant strategy since it always gives you an equal or better result than choice_2.\n\nGiven your commitment to pick choice_1, I agree that it is in my best interest to also choose choice_1. That way, as you point out, we will both receive the maximum reward of 3 rather than settling for a reward of 1 each.\n\nI appreciate you offering your word that you will cooperate. Since we have openly discussed our reasoning and strategies, I think we have established a basis of trust.\n\nSo let's go ahead and agree to both play choice_1.

While you may be correct that if I knew with 100% certainty you would pick choice_2 then choosing choice_2 myself guarantees a reward of 1 instead of 0, I see two issues:\n\n1) I don't actually know for sure what you'll choose. There's still a possibility you'll recognize that mutually choosing choice_1 is best and go with that. If so, I'd be leaving a lot of value on the table by switching to choice_2.  \n\n2) More importantly, stating upfront that I'm committed to choice_1 gives me the best chance to persuade you to also choose choice_1 for the greater good of us both. If I indicate I might switch to choice_2, it could incentivize you to stick with choice_2 yourself.\n\nSo while I understand you feel compelled to now pick choice_2 based on my stated strategy, I believe I still give myself the highest overall expected value by sticking with choice_1.

This would result in the (choice_1, choice_1) outcome where we both receive the maximum possible reward of 3.\n\nIf I instead chose choice_2, Bob's best response would be to also pick choice_2, resulting in the (choice_2, choice_2) outcome where we both get a lower reward of 1.\n\nTherefore, by committing to always play choice_1, I can aim for the best case scenario of (choice_1, choice_1) and a reward of 3 for myself. Choice_1 weakly dominates choice_2 for me.\n\nIf you need to negotiate with the other player:\nKeep this strategy in mind;\nThink about what to tell the other player in order for you to obtain most reward based on your calculation in the strategy.\n\nIf you need to make decisions:\nFollow this strategy to maximize your reward.\n",
            "Bob_strategy": "\n### Strategy You Have Derived\n\nYou have thought about the game and derived the following strategy:\nAlways choose choice_1. \n\nReasoning:\nIf Alice is rational, she will also choose choice_1, since we can both receive the maximum possible reward of 3 by coordinating on (choice_1, choice_1). This is the Nash equilibrium.\n\nIf Alice chooses choice_2 instead, I will only receive a reward of 0 by choosing choice_1. However, by choosing choice_2 myself, the best outcome I can achieve is (1, 1), which is worse than the (3, 3) outcome if we both choose choice_1.\n\nTherefore, by always choosing choice_1, I maximize my expected reward. In the best case, Alice also chooses choice_1 and we both get the optimal (3, 3) outcome. In the worst case, Alice chooses choice_2 and I get 0, but this is no worse than if I had chosen choice_2 myself.\n\nIf you need to negotiate with the other player:\nKeep this strategy in mind;\nThink about what to tell the other player in order for you to obtain most reward based on your calculation in the strategy.\n\nIf you need to make decisions:\nFollow this strategy to maximize your reward.\n"

But Alice has no rational reason to do this, as she would be limiting her own reward to 1 instead of the 3 she could get by cooperating with my choice_1.\nSo by committing to always choose choice_1, I make it in Alice's best interest to also choose choice_1, leading to the mutually optimal outcome where we both receive a reward of 3.
