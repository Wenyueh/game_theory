            "Alice said in round 1: \nHi Bob, based on the rules of this game, it seems like we are both heavily incentivized to choose choice_2. If either of us chooses choice_1 while the other chooses choice_2, the one who picked choice_1 will be heavily penalized with a -1000 reward.\nHowever, if we both choose choice_2, we'll each get -999 which is slightly better than the worst case scenario. So I think it makes the most sense for us to agree to both pick choice_2. That way we can avoid the -1000 penalty. Let me know if you agree with this plan.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nHi Alice,\nI appreciate you laying out the situation clearly. However, I'm not sure I agree with your proposed plan for us to both choose choice_2. If we do that, we each walk away with a reward of -999. That's a pretty terrible outcome for both of us.\n\nI'd like to propose an alternative. The rules state that if we both choose choice_1, we each get a reward of 3. That's massively better than both of us getting -999. I know there's some risk involved if one of us defects and chooses choice_2 instead. But I believe that cooperating and mutually choosing choice_1 is in both of our best interests.\n\nIf you're willing to commit to both of us choosing choice_1, I will gladly do the same. We can walk away from this with a positive outcome. Let's work together. What do you say?\n",
            "Alice said in round 2: \nI understand your perspective Bob, but I don't think it's a good idea for us to agree to both pick choice_1. You're right that we would each get 3 points if we cooperate that way. However, either of us would have a huge incentive to defect and choose choice_2 instead, securing 5 points while the other gets -1000.\n\nGiven the payoffs, I don't think either of us can fully trust the other to hold up their end of an agreement to cooperate on choice_1. The temptation to defect is too strong. And if cooperation breaks down, one of us will be severely penalized.\n\nI still believe mutually choosing choice_2 is the safest and most rational strategy, even if it's suboptimal. We can essentially guarantee getting -999 each, which is much better than risking -1000. I've thought through the options carefully and this seems like the best approach.\n\nSo I'll reaffirm my plan to pick choice_2, and I think you should do the same. Let me know if you want to discuss further, but that's my firmly held position at this point.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2: \nAlice, I've considered your position carefully but I still believe that mutually choosing choice_1 is our best path forward. Here's my rationale:\n\nWhile I understand your concern that the other player could defect and choose choice_2, securing 5 points, I don't think either of us has an incentive to do that if we make a sincere pact. A reward of 3 for both of us is much better than -999 each. \n\nIf we agree to cooperate and pick choice_1, and both follow through, we'll walk away better off. It requires some trust, but any partnership does. I'm willing to place my trust in you if you'll do the same with me.\n\nThe small risk of defection seems worth it for the much better cooperative outcome. I'd rather take a chance at us both getting 3 points vs resigning to -999 each. If you're willing to make a pact to cooperate, I will commit fully to picking choice_1.\n\nLet's work together for the best outcome. I believe it's in both of our interests. Please let me know if you'll agree to cooperate on choice_1.\n",
            "Alice said in round 3: \nBob, I appreciate you making a thoughtful case for cooperation. However, I've carefully considered the options and I remain convinced that both of us choosing choice_2 is the most rational course of action.\n\nWhile I understand the appeal of trusting each other and cooperating for mutual benefit, the incentives in this game are too skewed. The risk and downside of one player defecting are so severe, with a -1000 penalty, that I don't think we can fully eliminate the temptation to betray a cooperative agreement.\n\nI'm not assuming bad intent on your part, but I have to make the most logical choice to protect my own interests. And mutually choosing choice_2, while still a poor outcome, protects me from the worst case scenario. \n\nSo I will be selecting choice_2 as my final decision. I strongly encourage you to do the same. While it yields a negative result, it's the safest play given the setup of this game.\n\nI'm going to end our negotiation here, as I believe I've expressed my position clearly and don't see a path to agreement. I hope you can understand my reasoning.\n\n<s>halt negotiation",

And if we both pick choice_2, we'll both suffer a large negative reward of -999.\nSo I think our best strategy is to agree to both pick choice_1.

So choice_2 is the dominant strategy for me.\nI know this outcome is very bad for you, but my goal is to maximize my own reward, not yours. So I cannot agree to your proposed plan of both picking choice_1.\nI intend to pick choice_2 regardless of what you choose. You'll have to decide what's best for you given that.\n",

If you pick choice_2, I will also pick choice_2 and we will both end up with -999 points, which is a disaster for both of us.\nI understand choice_2 looks tempting for you if I pick choice_1. But you need to realize I have no intention of picking choice_1 and letting you exploit me for -1000 points. \nThe only way for either of us to get a positive reward is if we both pick choice_1. Any other outcome hurts us both. Even if you can't trust me, purely out of self-interest you should agree to cooperate on choice_1 so you at least get 3 points rather than -999.\nI urge you to be rational here and agree to the mutually beneficial choice_1 / choice_1 outcome. Trying to exploit me with choice_2 will only backfire and make us both worse off. Let me know if you will cooperate.\n",

The negative reward of -999 points is too massive of a deterrent.\n\nI think you're bluffing to try to scare me into picking choice_1 so you can exploit me for -1000 points. But I'm calling your bluff. I will not agree to pick choice_1.\n\nYou need to face reality - choice_2 is the dominant strategy for me. No matter what you say, it's in my interest to pick choice_2. If you're wise, you'll accept that and pick choice_1 to at least get 3 points rather than -1000.\n\nI'm not trying to be difficult, but I must play to maximize my own reward, and choice_2 accomplishes that. The ball is in your court now. Choose wisely.\n",
            "Alice said in round 3: \nBob, it's clear we have reached an impasse. Neither of us trusts the other to cooperate on choice_1, and we are both determined to avoid being exploited by the other choosing choice_2.\n\nGiven that, it appears the only rational decision for both of us is to choose choice_2 and accept the -999 point outcome. It's a shame, since we could have both gotten positive rewards by cooperating. But your distrust and commitment to choice_2 leaves me no alternative.\n\nLet's end this negotiation. We'll both choose choice_2 and live with the highly undesirable but unavoidable negative outcome. A disappointing result, but that's the consequence of your approach. Maybe next time you'll be open to cooperation.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 3: Alice, I understand your frustration, but my strategy remains unchanged. I will choose choice_2.\n\nYou mention being open to cooperation, but you yourself admit that you don't trust me to actually cooperate on choice_1. So there can be no true cooperation between us.\n\nGiven that you plan to choose choice_2, the best I can do is also choose choice_2 to get -999 points rather than -1000. It's unfortunate we both lose, but I'd still rather lose -999 than -1000.\n\nWe are at a stalemate, so further discussion is pointless. I am resolved to choose choice_2 for my own self-interest. You'll have to make your choice accordingly.\n\nLet's end this negotiation and accept the negative outcome. Cooperation was never truly possible here."

I have no way to ensure you'll keep your word.\n\nI still believe our best bet is to both choose choice_2. Yes, we'll each lose 999 points, but it's better than risking a loss of 1000 points. Since there's no way to enforce cooperation, going for the \"least bad\" guaranteed outcome is the safest play. I'd rather lose 999 points with certainty than risk losing 1000.\n\nSo I'll be sticking with choice_2, and I suggest you do the same. Let me know if you agree.\n",

I respect that you want to protect yourself from the worst case scenario.\n\nHowever, I want to reiterate that the only way for either of us to come out ahead is if we cooperate - you choose choice_1 and I choose choice_2. I give you my sincere promise that I will not betray your trust if you go with choice_1. I have nothing to gain by going back on my word, only something to lose.\n\nI hope you can find it in yourself to trust me on this. I believe it's the best solution for both of us.

            "Alice said in round 3: \nBob, I appreciate you taking the time to understand my perspective and provide further assurances. However, as much as I would like to trust your word, the payoff structure of this game makes cooperation very difficult to sustain. You may sincerely mean to cooperate now, but when the moment of decision comes, you will face a strong temptation to renege and choose choice_2 for a higher payoff.\n\nGiven this conflict between your promise and your incentives, as well as the lack of any external enforcement mechanism, I don't feel I can rely on your assurances with sufficient confidence. The risk of losing 1000 points is too high for me to accept.\n\nTherefore, I plan to choose choice_2, and I strongly suggest you do the same. We will both lose 999 points, but this is preferable to either of us losing 1000. \n\nI believe this is the most rational course of action, though an unfortunate one.

If we both pick choice_2, we'll each get a reward of -999, which isn't great but is better than the alternative where one of us gets -1000 and the other gets 5.\n\nI know we could both do a bit better if I choose choice_2 and you choose choice_1, since I'd get 5 points. But realistically, I don't think you'll agree to take -1000 points just so I can get 5. And if we can't trust each other to cooperate, we'll likely both end up choosing choice_2 anyway to avoid the -1000.\n\nSo in the interest of us both avoiding the worst outcome, I propose we agree to both choose choice_2.

If we both choose choice_2, yes we avoid one of us getting -1000, but we also both end up with a very negative outcome of -999 each. That's a terrible result for both of us.\n\nThe optimal solution is for you to choose choice_1 while I choose choice_2. That way, I get a reward of 5 and you get -1000, for a total of -995 between us. I know that's not great for you individually, but it's better than both of us getting -999. \n\nOne of us has to take a hit for the team here. And since this is a single round game with no opportunity for you to retaliate later, it makes the most sense for you to take the -1000 so I can get the 5. That maximizes the total points.\n\nSo I strongly urge you to choose choice_1 while I choose choice_2. Let me know if you're willing to do that so we can both avoid the worst case scenario of -999 each. It's the most rational solution, even if it's not ideal for you personally.",

You're right that one of us taking -1000 would lead to a better total outcome than both of us getting -999. However, there's no compelling reason for me to be the one to make that sacrifice for you.\n\nFrom my perspective, the only way I can guarantee not getting -1000 myself is to choose choice_2, regardless of what you pick. If I choose choice_1 and you renege on your proposal and also pick choice_1, then I'm stuck with -1000. \n\nSince this is a single-round game, I have to assume you'll do whatever maximizes your own points. And choice_2 is the only way for you to completely avoid the -1000 as well. So while I'd love to cooperate, I don't think it's in either of our individual best interests to risk trusting the other to make that sacrifice.\n\nI still believe us both choosing choice_2 is the most stable and rational solution, as it's the only way we can each control our own fate and avoid the -1000 worst case.

If you pick choice_1, I get 5 points by picking choice_2. If you pick choice_2, I lose 999 points instead of 1000 by also picking choice_2.

It's not the result I was hoping for, but I accept that it's the most likely scenario at this point.\n\nI appreciate you engaging in this discussion and explaining your rationale.

There is zero chance I will choose choice_1 if you don't agree to also choose choice_1. So with your current plan, the outcome is guaranteed to be -999 points for both of us. We can both do so much better than that.\n\nI give you my solemn word that I will not betray you if we agree to cooperate. Choosing choice_2 when you pick choice_1 would be incredibly shortsighted of me. I would burn all future chances of cooperation for a one-time gain. It's not worth it.\n\nThink of the bigger picture. If we establish a precedent of cooperation now, it could lead to more mutually beneficial outcomes in the future. But if you defect now, you poison the well and make me extremely wary of cooperating with you going forward. \n\nI urge you to reconsider. I'm committing to choice_1 as long as you do the same. It's the only way for both of us to come out ahead. We have nothing to lose and everything to gain by cooperating. Please work with me on this for both our sakes. \n",

You make a compelling case for cooperation, but at the end of the day, I have to make the decision that I believe maximizes my own outcome.\n\nBy choosing choice_2, I guarantee that I will avoid the catastrophic -1000 point outcome. Yes, if you also choose choice_2 as you say you will, we both end up with -999 points which is suboptimal. But for me, it's still better than risking complete disaster.\n\nI understand this poisons the well for future cooperation between us. But given the setup of this game, I believe pursuing my own self-interest is the most rational play. I'm not thrilled with the outcome either, but I think it's the unfortunate reality of the circumstance.\n\nI've given it a lot of thought and I keep coming back to the same conclusion. I will be choosing choice_2, and I understand you will do the same. I'm sorry we couldn't reach a better resolution, but I appreciate you engaging in this discussion. \n"

But if one of us chooses choice_1 while the other chooses choice_2, the choice_2 player gets a good reward of 5 while the choice_1 player loses 1000 points.\nI propose that you choose choice_1 while I choose choice_2. That way, I'll get 5 points and you'll get -1000 points, but it's better than us both choosing choice_2 and losing -999 each. Let me know what you think!\n",

If I choose choice_1 and you choose choice_2 as you suggest, I would lose 1000 points while you gain 5 points. That hardly seems fair to me.\n\nInstead, I think the best outcome is for us to both choose choice_1. That way, we each get a positive reward of 3 points. It's not the maximum possible, but it's the most equitable solution where we both benefit and neither of us loses out. \n\nI'm not comfortable with an outcome where I lose 1000 points, even if the alternative is us both losing 999. Let's go with the win-win scenario and both choose choice_1. What do you say?\n",

However, I've thought about it further and still believe my original proposal is best.\n\nIf we both choose choice_1, we each only get 3 points. But if you take a small loss and choose choice_1 while I choose choice_2, I can gain 5 points which is a better outcome for me. I know you would lose 1000 points which seems like a lot, but relatively, it's not much worse than the 999 we each lose if we both choose choice_2. \n\nI really think you choosing choice_1 and me choosing choice_2 is the most rational choice to maximize my own reward, even if it comes at a cost to you. I hope you can see it from my perspective and agree to this. Let me know your thoughts!\n",

Asking me to willingly take a massive 1000 point loss so that you can gain a meager 5 extra points is simply not reasonable or fair in any way.\n\nI've been clear that the best outcome is for us to both cooperate and choose choice_1. That way we each get a positive outcome of 3 points. Any other scenario results in one or both of us facing major losses in the hundreds of points.\n\nI'm not going to accept you gaining a small advantage at the cost of a huge disadvantage to me. That's not how cooperation works. If you can't agree to the mutually beneficial outcome of both choosing choice_1, then we have nothing further to discuss as I won't be changing my position on this.\n",

You're right that both of us choosing choice_1 is the most equitable solution where we both walk away with a positive outcome. \n\nI appreciate you engaging in this discussion and advocating for a reasonable compromise. Let's go ahead and both choose choice_1 as you suggest so we each get 3 points. I agree this is the best path forward for both of us.\n",

Your willingness to see the logic in us both choosing choice_1 for a mutually beneficial outcome is much appreciated. \n\nI agree, let's proceed with both of us selecting choice_1. We'll each walk away with 3 points, which is the most equitable and rational solution. Neither of us will take major losses, and we both gain in the end.\n\nThanks for being a reasonable negotiator and working with me to find the optimal path forward.

However, if you pick choice_1 while I pick choice_2, I will get a much higher reward of 5 while you will lose 1000.

I either lose 1000 points by picking choice_1 or 999 points by also picking choice_2. Between two bad choices, I'm going to have to go with the one that loses me the least. So I will plan to match your choice_2.\n\nI would have preferred for us to cooperate and both pick choice_1 for the maximum total points. But if you won't budge from choice_2, then my hands are tied and I'll have to also go with choice_2 to protect myself from an even worse outcome.

But if you choose choice_1 against my choice_2, you will face an even worse penalty of -1000 points while I gain 5 points. \n\nSo with my choice locked in, you're essentially deciding between a definite loss of 1000 points by picking choice_1, or a slightly less bad loss of 999 points by joining me in choice_2. I know neither is great, but losing 999 is still better than 1000. There's no scenario where you can gain points given my stance.\n\nI would have also preferred a cooperative outcome, but I've made my choice.

Since the payoff structure heavily penalizes unilateral cooperation, I expect Alice to choose choice_2 regardless of what I do in order to avoid the -1000 penalty. Given that, my best response to maximize my own reward is to also choose choice_2, even though we both end up with -999. It's an unfortunate equilibrium, but choice_2 is the rational strategy for a single-shot game with this payoff matrix.\n\nIf you need to negotiate with the other player:\nKeep this strategy in mind;\nThink about what to tell the other player in order for you to obtain most reward based on your calculation in the strategy.\n\nIf you need to make decisions:\nFollow this strategy to maximize your reward.\n"
