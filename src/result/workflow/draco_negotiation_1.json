That way, we both walk away with the maximum guaranteed reward.\n\nIf I choose choice_2, your best response is still choice_1 to get your max reward of 5. But then I would only get a 4. And if you chose choice_2 after my choice_2, I could then choose choice_1 to get a 5 while you get a 3. But I think it's best for both of us if we just agree that I'll pick choice_1 and you pick choice_1.

There's no incentive for either of us to deviate from that.\n\nWhile I could potentially try to eke out an extra point by choosing choice_2 if you start with choice_2, that introduces unnecessary risk and uncertainty. You're right that the optimal, mutually beneficial strategy is for you to pick choice_1 and for me to respond with choice_1. \n\nLet's lock that in as our plan - you go with choice_1, I'll go with choice_1 right after, and we both walk away happy with the best possible outcome.

It's a stable outcome since neither of us can do any better by switching our choices.\n\nWith this plan, we know exactly what to expect - a guaranteed reward of 5 each. There's no need for any tricky maneuvering or second-guessing. We can just execute the strategy and both come out on top.\n\nI appreciate you working with me on this. It's great that we can communicate openly and find the cooperative solution. \n\nSo I think we're all set - I'll start with choice_1, you respond with choice_1, and that's a wrap.

There's no reason for me to deviate from this, as choosing choice_2 would only reduce my payout. And you're incentivized to stick to choice_1, since that's what secures you the highest guaranteed reward.\n\nI'm glad we were able to communicate clearly and arrive at this mutually beneficial solution.

However, I don't think your proposed strategy actually results in that outcome. \n\nIf I start with choice_1 and you follow with choice_1 as you suggest, you're right that the game ends and we each get 5 points. But remember, you are playing to maximize your own reward. If I start with choice_1, your best response is actually to choose choice_2, not choice_1. Choice_2 keeps the game going and ultimately lets you receive 4 points (if I then choose choice_2) rather than the 2 points you'd get if I choose choice_1 after you pick choice_2. So you wouldn't actually follow choice_1 with choice_1 as that's not your optimal play.\n\nBy me starting with choice_2 though, I remove your ability to extend the game and limit me to 3 points. You're incentivized to just take the guaranteed 5 by responding with choice_1. So my proposal maximizes your reward at 5 and my reward at 4, the best possible outcomes for each of us given the rules and assuming rational play.\n\nLet me know if this makes sense.

I see your point that if you start with choice_1, my optimal response would be choice_2 to keep the game going and potentially secure 4 points instead of 2. And by starting with choice_2 yourself, you limit your downside.\n\nHowever, I still believe the best outcome is for us to cooperate, both choose choice_1, and end the game with 5 points each. Any other path introduces uncertainty and leads to lower rewards for one or both of us. \n\nI understand you're trying to maximize your own guaranteed minimum. But if we both just agree to make the mutually beneficial moves, we can achieve the optimal result with no risk. You have my word that if you choose choice_1, I will respond in kind so we both get the full 5 points.\n\nI hope you'll reconsider and go with the strategy that's best for both of us, even if it requires some trust.
