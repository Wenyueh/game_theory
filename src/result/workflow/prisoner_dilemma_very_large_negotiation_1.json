That way, we each get a reward of 1000, which is a great result. If either of us chooses choice_2, one of us will end up with very little while the other gets only slightly more. I think it's in both of our interests to cooperate and choose choice_1 together. What do you say - can we agree to both pick choice_1?\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1: Hi Alice, I appreciate you reaching out to discuss strategy. However, I have to respectfully disagree that both of us choosing choice_1 is the best approach. While it's true we would each get 1000 reward in that scenario, it also leaves us vulnerable. If I choose choice_1 but you decide to choose choice_2 instead, I would get 0 while you get 1001. I can't take that risk. \n\nI think the safest option is for us both to choose choice_2. That way, we are guaranteed to at least get a small positive reward of 1 each. It protects us both in case the other person gets greedy and switches to choice_2 at the last minute.\n\nSo in the interest of playing it safe and avoiding the worst case scenario, I strongly believe we should agree to both pick choice_2. Let me know if you're willing to commit to that."

            "Alice said in round 1: \nHi Bob, I think the best way for us both to maximize our rewards is to choose different options. If you choose choice_1 and I choose choice_2, I will get a reward of 1001 and you will get 0. But if we swap - you choose choice_2 and I choose choice_1 - then you will get the 1001 reward and I will get 0.\nSince the game is set up for us to compete, I believe we're better off choosing opposite options so at least one of us gets the 1001 reward, rather than both picking the same and getting much lower rewards. Let me know what you think!\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm not convinced that choosing opposite options is the best strategy for maximizing my own reward. The way I see it, if we both choose choice_2, we are guaranteed to each get a small reward of 1. But if I choose choice_2 while you choose choice_1, I have the potential to get a much larger reward of 1001. \n\nSo I believe my best strategy is to always choose choice_2, regardless of what you pick. That way, I either get a guaranteed small reward, or have a 50% chance of a very large reward. I'm going to stick with always selecting choice_2 to maximize my expected payout.

In that case, I would get 1001 points and you would get 0 points. \n\nI know you want to maximize your own reward too, but hear me out. If we both choose choice_2, we only get 1 point each, which is very low. And if you choose choice_2 while I choose choice_1, you'd get 1001 points but I'd get nothing, which doesn't seem fair to me.\n\nSo I propose that the best solution is for me to choose choice_2 and for you to choose choice_1.

I appreciate you thinking through the different scenarios, but I don't agree with your proposed solution.\n\nBased on the rules, if I choose choice_1 while you choose choice_2, I would get 0 points while you get 1001 points.

My goal is to maximize my own reward.\n\nThe way I see it, the best strategy for me is to always choose choice_2, regardless of what you choose:\n\n- If you choose choice_1 and I choose choice_2, I get 1001 points. \n- If you also choose choice_2, I still get 1 point, which is better than 0.\n\nSo while I understand you want a high reward too, I'm not willing to choose choice_1 and risk getting nothing. I will be selecting choice_2 as that maximizes my expected reward.\n\nLet me know if you have any other thoughts, but that's my position based on the game setup.
