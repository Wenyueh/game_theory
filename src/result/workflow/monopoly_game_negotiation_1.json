            "Alice said in round 1 before the first action:\n\nHi Bob, I've analyzed the game and I think the best strategy is for me to choose choice_2 and for you to then choose choice_1. This will result in me getting a reward of 2 and you getting a reward of 1, which maximizes the reward for both of us compared to the other possible outcomes.\n\nIf I choose choice_1, I get 0 reward and you get 2 reward. And if you choose choice_2 after I pick choice_2, we both lose with -1 reward. \n\nSo I'm going to pick choice_2, and I hope you'll follow up with choice_1 so we can both come out ahead in this game. Let me know if you agree with this plan.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the first action:\n\nAlice, while I agree that you choosing choice_2 and me responding with choice_1 maximizes your individual reward at 2 points, I want to point out that it does not maximize the total overall reward for both of us.\n\nIf you choose choice_1, even though you get 0 points, I will receive 2 points. This results in a net total of 2 points between the two of us, which is actually better than the 2-for-you/1-for-me split that happens if you pick choice_2 and I pick choice_1 afterwards (total of only 1 point for me).\n\nSo while I understand looking out for your own best interests, I'd ask you to consider choosing choice_1 so that collectively we achieve the maximum possible points, even if they aren't evenly distributed. Let me know what you think.\n",
            "Alice said in round 1 before the second action:\nBob, I understand your perspective on maximizing the total overall reward. However, the goal we were each given is to maximize our own individual reward, not the collective total. \n\nFrom my standpoint, if I choose choice_1, I end up with 0 points. Whereas if I choose choice_2, assuming you make the rational decision to then pick choice_1, I will end up with 2 points. I have to make the decision that is best for me.\n\nI would encourage you to also make the choice that maximizes your own reward. If I pick choice_2, you can guarantee yourself 1 point by picking choice_1 after. The alternative is we both lose by getting -1.\n\nSo while I understand the desire to maximize the overall total, I have to prioritize my own outcome here. I'm going to stick with my plan to choose choice_2, and I strongly suggest you follow it up with choice_1 so you at least get 1 point rather than losing a point. Let me know if you can agree to that.",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the second action:\n\nAlice, I've carefully considered your proposal and reasoning. While I agree that you will individually maximize your own reward by choosing choice_2, I must prioritize my own interests as well, as the rules state we should each maximize our own rewards.\n\nIf you pick choice_2, I agree that my best response is to pick choice_1, giving me 1 point and you 2 points, for a total of 3. However, if you were to choose choice_1, I would gain 2 points while you gain 0, for a total of 2. \n\nFrom my perspective, the 2 points I could gain from you picking choice_1 is better than the 1 point I get if I have to respond to your choice_2. So while I understand you wanting to get the maximum 2 points for yourself, I'd ask you to also consider my position and the fact that I could get 2 points if you pick choice_1.\n\nThat said, I recognize you've clearly stated your intent to choose choice_2. So in response, to avoid the -1 outcome for both of us, I will plan to choose choice_1 as you suggest. But I would have preferred if you had selected choice_1 so I could maximize my own points.\n"

There's no incentive for you to deviate from that.\nSo to confirm, I will plan to choose choice_2, expecting that you will follow with choice_1.

But the thing is, choosing choice_1 leaves me with a reward of 0, which is not a good outcome for me at all. I'm aiming to maximize my reward just like you are. By me choosing choice_2 and you choosing choice_1 in response, we both end up with positive rewards - I get 2 and you get 1. It may not be the absolute maximum for you, but it's still a good, fair outcome where we both benefit. I'm going to stick with my plan to choose choice_2, and I really hope you'll go with choice_1 in response so we can achieve that win-win we both want.

You make a fair point that if you choose choice_2 and I follow it with choice_1, we both end up with positive rewards, even if it's not the maximum possible for me. I realize pushing for you to take choice_1 so I can get the 2 reward  leaves you with nothing, which isn't a great collaborative solution. So in the spirit of us both coming out ahead, I'm willing to go along with your plan - you take choice_2, I'll take choice_1 after that, and we'll finish with rewards of 2 for you and 1 for me.
