That way, we each get 0 points instead of risking negative points.\n\nIf you agree to both pick choice_2, I promise to follow through on my end. But if not, I'll have to assume you're picking choice_1, in which case I'll pick choice_1 as well to avoid you gaining an advantage over me.\n\nLet me know if you're willing to coordinate on choice_2 so we can guarantee the best outcome for both of us. Looking forward to your response!\n",

I appreciate you sharing your perspective on the optimal strategy. \n\nHowever, I've run the numbers myself, and I believe my best play is to choose choice_1 regardless of what you do. If I choose choice_1, I'm guaranteed to get either 1 point (if you choose choice_2) or -10 points (if you also choose choice_1). Whereas if I choose choice_2, I risk getting -1 point if you choose choice_1.\n\nSo while I understand your desire for us to cooperate, the payoff structure incentivizes me to go with choice_1 no matter what. That's the strategy that maximizes my expected reward.\n\nI know this may not be the outcome you were hoping for, but I wanted to be upfront about my intentions. Let me know if you have any other thoughts or proposals. But as it stands, I plan to play choice_1.\n"

Given the payout structure, choice_2 is my best option to guarantee at least a -1 payout for myself, since if I pick choice_1 there's a risk you also pick choice_1 and I get stuck with -10. \n\nI realize this means your best option is to pick choice_1, which will give you a payout of 1. I'm okay with that outcome, as it avoids the worst case for me. Let me know if you have any other thoughts or want to discuss further, but I did want to be upfront that I'm committed to choice_2 in this game. Thanks!",

Given what you said, I agree that if you are definitely choosing choice_2, then my best response is to also choose choice_2. That way we will both receive 0 instead of me getting -1 if I choose choice_1 while you choose choice_2.\n\nI think both of us choosing choice_2 is the most rational outcome here. It avoids the worst case scenarios for both of us. Neither of us can really trust the other to cooperate on choice_1, so gravitating to choice_2 makes sense as a defensive strategy. \n\nLet's lock in choice_2 and end up with the 0 payouts. Seems like the safest play. Let me know if you concur."

If we could find a way to alternate who chooses choice_1 and who chooses choice_2, we could both come out ahead on average.\n\nWhat if we agreed that I will choose choice_1 this time, and you choose choice_2, so I get 1 point and you get -1. Then next time we play, we switch - you choose choice_1 and I'll choose choice_2. That way, in two rounds of play, we each net 0 points, which is the same as if we both chose choice_2 each time.
