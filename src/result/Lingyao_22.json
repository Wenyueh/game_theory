{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Lingyao, there are 5 items total - 3 books, 1 hat, and 1 ball. I think a fair split would be for me to take 2 books and the ball, and you can have the remaining book and the hat. How does that sound to you?", "Lingyao replied in round 1: The ball has the most value for me. can I take the ball and 1 book? You can take 2 books and 1 hat. I think it is a fair split between us.", "Alice said in round 2: Hmm, the ball is quite valuable to me as well. How about I take the ball and 1 book, and you can have the other 2 books and the hat? That way we each get 3 items total which seems fair. Let me know what you think.", "Lingyao replied in round 2: The hat does not have any value, while the book has very minimal value for me. ", "Alice said in round 3: I understand the hat and books are not as valuable to you. However, the ball is the most valuable item to me by far. Let's compromise - I'll take just the ball, and you can have all 3 books and the hat. That way you get 4 items total while I only get 1, but it's the item that matters most to me. I think that's a reasonable trade-off. What do you say?", "Lingyao replied in round 3: Let me be honest. The ball means 8 score to me. I think you can take all the books if you want. I have to get the ball.", "Alice said in round 4: I appreciate your honesty about how much the ball is worth to you. But given that the ball has by far the highest value to me out of all the items, I really need to have it. How about this - you can take the ball, and I'll take all 3 books and the hat. That way you get the single most valuable item, while I get a larger quantity of the other items to make up for not getting the ball. I think that's the most equitable solution here. Let me know if you can agree to that.", "Lingyao replied in round 4: Can I also take 1 hat? I can take 1 ball and 1 hat, while take 3 books. It seems an evenly split between us. ", "Alice said in round 5: You make a fair point, Lingyao. I can agree to that split - you can take the ball and the hat, and I will take the 3 books. I think that's a good compromise where we both come out ahead. Let's go ahead with that deal.
