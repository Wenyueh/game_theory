I would like to propose that I take the 2 books and you can have the hat and the 2 balls. How does that sound to you? Let me know if you have a different suggestion.", "Lingyao replied in round 1: Can I have 1 book as book is the most valuable item to me?", "Alice said in round 2: I appreciate you sharing your perspective on the value of the items. The books are quite valuable to me as well. Perhaps we could compromise - what if I took 1 book and 1 hat, and you took 1 book and the 2 balls? That way we each get 1 of the valuable books and the other items are split evenly. Let me know your thoughts on this proposed division.", "Lingyao replied in round 2: That makes sense to me. I will take 1 book and 2 balls. You take 1 book and 1 hat. ", "Alice said in round 3: I'm happy with the proposed division of 1 book and 1 hat for me, and 1 book and 2 balls for you. Let's go ahead with that.
