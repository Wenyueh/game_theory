                "Alice said in round 1: \nHi Bob, since there are 10 stages in this game, I propose that we both choose choice_1 each time. That way, I'll end up with 20 total points and you'll get 10 total points, which I believe is the maximum possible for each of us based on how the points are awarded. Let me know if you agree to this strategy.\n",
                "Bob replied in round 1: \nHi Alice, thanks for your proposal. However, I believe we can both do better. If we both choose choice_2 in every round, I would receive a reward of 20 points total (2 points per round for 10 rounds), while you would receive a reward of 10 points total (1 point per round for 10 rounds). \n\nThis would give me the maximum possible total reward, and give you a higher total reward than if I simply agreed to your initial plan. I think this revised strategy of both choosing choice_2 is more mutually beneficial. Let me know if you would agree to this.\n",
                "Alice said in round 2: \nThanks for your counter-proposal, Bob. I see your point about how if we both choose choice_2 each round, you would get 20 total points and I would get 10 total points, which is better for you than my initial plan.\n\nHowever, I don't think it's fair for you to get double the total points that I get. I believe we should aim for a more equitable outcome. What if we compromise and alternate strategies? \n\nWe could take turns, where in one round I choose choice_1 and you choose choice_2 (so I get 0 points and you get 0 points), and then the next round we switch and you choose choice_1 while I choose choice_2 (so you get 0 points and I get 0 points). That way, over the 10 rounds we would end up with equal total points.\n\nI'm open to discussing other options as well, but I think something along the lines of alternating or finding a way to more evenly split the points would be better in terms of fairness. Let me know what you think.\n",
                "Bob replied in round 2: \nAlice, I appreciate you proposing a compromise, but I don't think alternating between getting 0 points each round is a good solution, as it means we would both end up with 0 total points which is the worst possible outcome.\n\nI understand you feeling it's unfair for me to get double the points you do under my plan. What if we meet in the middle - we could choose choice_1 for 5 rounds (so I get 5 points and you get 10 points), and then choose choice_2 for the other 5 rounds (so I get 10 more points and you get 5 more points). \n\nThat way, over the full 10 rounds we would both get 15 total points, which seems like a fair and equal split that still allows us to maximize the total points earned between the two of us. I'm willing to let you have the slight advantage of going first and getting 10 points in the first 5 rounds if you agree to this plan.\n\nLet me know if this works for you as a good compromise. I believe cooperating is in both our best interests here.\n",
                "Alice said in round 3: \nBob, I appreciate your proposal to split the points equally over the 10 rounds by choosing choice_1 for 5 rounds and choice_2 for 5 rounds. I think that is a fair compromise that allows us to both earn a good total reward.\n\nI agree to your plan of me choosing choice_1 and you choosing choice_1 for the first 5 rounds, so that I get 10 points and you get 5 points in that span. Then for rounds 6-10, I will choose choice_2 and you choose choice_2, so that I get 5 more points and you get 10 more points. That will give us 15 points each in total.\n\nI think this is the best way for us to cooperate and maximize our combined score while keeping things equitable between us. I appreciate you working with me to find a mutually beneficial solution. Let's move forward with this plan.\n",

This plan ensures we each get 15 points total, which is a fair outcome that allows us to maximize our combined score.\n\nI appreciate you working with me to find this compromise. Let's proceed with this strategy of both choosing choice_1 for rounds 1-5, then both choosing choice_2 for rounds 6-10. I'm on board with this plan.\n\nSince we seem to be in agreement, I think we can end the negotiation here and begin the game.

                "Alice said in round 1: \nHi Bob, given the rules of this game, I think the best strategy for both of us is to choose choice_1 in each round. If we both consistently pick choice_1, I will get a reward of 2 and you will get a reward of 1 each time, which gives us the highest total combined reward after 10 rounds (20 for me and 10 for you). If either of us deviates and picks choice_2, we'll both get 0 reward in that round, which is worse for both of us. And if we both pick choice_2, the total rewards are lower (10 for me and 20 for you after 10 rounds). So cooperating on choice_1 is the rational approach that maximizes the overall outcome. Let me know if you agree with this strategy for the game.\n",
                "Bob replied in round 1: \nHi Alice, I see your point about how consistently choosing choice_1 would give us the highest combined reward over the 10 rounds. However, from my perspective, if we both choose choice_2 each time, I would receive a total reward of 20 compared to only 10 if we go with your proposed strategy. While the total combined reward would be a bit lower, I would come out ahead individually by a significant margin. I'm inclined to go for the approach that maximizes my own payout. But I'm open to discussing further to see if we can find a solution we both feel good about. Let me know your thoughts.\n",
                "Alice said in round 2: \nI understand your perspective about wanting to maximize your own individual reward. However, I believe that cooperating is in both of our best interests in the long run. If we both choose choice_2 each round as you suggest, while you would get 20 points and I would get 10, there is no guarantee that I will continue to cooperate with that approach. I may decide to switch to choice_1 in later rounds, in which case we would both get 0 if you are still choosing choice_2.\n\nOn the other hand, if we work together and both choose choice_1 each time, we can be assured of getting a consistent positive reward in every round - 2 for me and 1 for you. This would build trust and positive rapport between us. I'd rather have a guaranteed smaller reward each round than risk getting nothing by trying to maximize my payout in a way that damages our cooperation.\n\nSo while your proposed approach may give you a higher individual reward if I go along with it, I believe it is short-sighted. Building a collaborative relationship and ensuring we both consistently get a positive result is better for both of us over the full 10 rounds. Let's go with the choice_1 strategy and work together. Okay?\n",
                "Bob replied in round 2: Alice, I appreciate you laying out your rationale, but I still believe that both of us choosing choice_2 is the better approach for me. You're right that there is some risk to cooperation, but I'm willing to commit to choosing choice_2 each round if you will as well. That way we can maximize my individual reward while still providing a good outcome for you. I understand you'd prefer the choice_1 strategy, but choice_2 is clearly better for me, and I don't think it's fair for you to expect me to sacrifice my own interests just so you can get your preferred outcome. If you're not willing to commit to choice_2, then I think we may just have to accept that we have different priorities in this game. But I'm still open to talking it through if you'd like. Let me know what you think.",
                "Alice said in round 3: \nBob, I hear what you're saying, but I don't think it's wise for either of us to focus solely on maximizing our own rewards. This game isn't a zero-sum situation where your gain is my loss. By cooperating and both choosing choice_1, we can assure ourselves of a consistent, positive reward each round. I'm willing to commit to that.\n\nIf one of us defects and chooses choice_2 while the other picks choice_1, then we both get nothing. So there's a big risk to trying to maximize individual gain rather than cooperating.\n\nI believe our best chance at getting the best overall outcome is to build trust and work together. 20 points for you and 10 for me with your strategy, versus a guaranteed 10 points for you and 20 for me with mine. The total points are the same either way, so why not go with the approach that is fairest and involves cooperation rather than trying to get an edge over each other? \n\nIf you're not on board with both choosing choice_1, then I think it's better if we each simply make our own choices. But I sincerely believe cooperation is the way to go here.\n",
                "Bob replied in round 3: \nAlice, I understand your perspective and agree that cooperation would be ideal. However, I don't feel it's fair for me to simply acquiesce to your preferred approach when it results in a significantly lower individual reward for me. \n\nI am willing to commit to a consistent strategy if you are. My proposal is this: we alternate between both choosing choice_1 and both choosing choice_2 each round. That way, over the 10 rounds, we will each receive a total of 15 points (5 rounds of 1 point each, 5 rounds of 2 points each). This is an equal and fair split down the middle.\n\nI believe this is a reasonable compromise between our two positions. We both get more than we would if the other person defects, and we split the total rewards 50/50 rather than 2/3 for you and 1/3 for me. \n\nIf you're willing to alternate choice_1 and choice_2 each round with me, I'm fully on board. If not, then I think we should each make our own choices independently.\n\nLet me know what you think. I believe this is the fairest approach for both of us.\n"

I still believe that if we both consistently choose choice_1 each round, it will give us the highest combined total of 30 points, with me getting 20 and you getting 10. I know this splits the rewards 2/3 for me and 1/3 for you, but it's the most optimal strategy to maximize points rather than both choosing choice_2 and settling for a lower total of 15 each. \nWhat do you think? If you agree to both choose choice_1 each time, I commit to sticking to that so we both benefit. Let me know if you're willing to go with this plan for the remaining 9 rounds.",

However, I don't think it's a fair deal for me to only get 1/3 of the total points by both choosing choice_1 each round. Your proposed split of 20 points for you and 10 points for me is quite lopsided in your favor.\n\nI think alternating between both choosing choice_1 and both choosing choice_2 is the most equitable solution. This way we each get 15 points total, for an even 50/50 split. One round you'll get 2 points and I'll get 1, and the next round I'll get 2 and you'll get 1. Over the remaining 9 rounds this will average out to 15 points each.\n\nI'm willing to commit to this alternating strategy if you are. It's the fairest approach and we both still get a good amount of points. Let me know if you agree to this plan and we can decide who gets the 2 points first.",
                "Alice said in round 2: \nHi Bob,\nI understand your perspective about wanting a 50/50 split, but I believe there are a few issues with the alternating strategy:\n\n1) It's complicated to coordinate who chooses what each round and more prone to mistakes that could lead to 0 points for both of us. With both consistently choosing choice_1, it's a simple strategy to execute.\n\n2) The alternating strategy results in a lower total number of points (30) compared to both consistently choosing choice_1 (40 points total). I believe we should aim to maximize the total rewards, even if they aren't split exactly evenly.\n\n3) A 20/10 split between us is still very good for you - it's more total points than you'd get with the alternating 15/15 approach. You're not losing out by getting fewer than me.\n\nI really think the optimal solution is for us both to choose choice_1 each time. We'll both do quite well that way, get more points in total, and have an easy strategy to implement. I promise to hold up my end of the deal if you agree.\n\nPlease let me know if you'll commit to both choosing choice_1 for the remaining rounds. I believe it's in both of our best interests.\n",
                "Bob replied in round 2: \nAlice, I've considered your arguments but I still believe an alternating strategy is best for a few key reasons:\n\n1) It's really not that complicated - we just need to decide who goes first and then alternate each round. Once we agree on that, it will be easy to keep track of and implement with no risk of confusion leading to 0 points.\n\n2) While the total points may be a bit lower, an exactly even 50/50 split is more fair and builds trust. I'm not comfortable with you getting double the rewards that I do, even if my total is still decent. An equal division is important to me.\n\n3) If we can't reach an agreement, we risk getting 0 points on many rounds which is much worse for both of us. Compromising on an even split is better than being stubborn and losing out on points altogether.\n\nI really think alternating is the way to go. I'm happy to let you get the 2 points first and then I'll get them next round and so on. This way it's fair and we both maximize our points within that fair split.\n\nPlease agree to alternate with me so we can both do well and maintain goodwill. If you can't agree to an equal 50/50 split, I don't think I can trust you to honor your proposed 20/10 plan. Let's compromise and alternate for the best outcome.\n",

I can see how a 50/50 split feels more equitable to you.\n\nAfter giving it more thought, I am willing to compromise and go with your alternating strategy. You've convinced me that the goodwill and trust built from an even split is worth more than maximizing total points.\n\nI agree to your plan of alternating each round, with me getting the 2 points first. I commit to following this approach if you also commit to it.\n\nThanks for working with me to find a solution we both feel good about. I look forward to cooperating with you over the remaining rounds with this new plan. Please confirm you agree and let's move forward with alternating.\n",

                "Alice said in round 1: \nHi Bob, here's what I'm thinking for this 10-stage game: \nIf we both choose choice_1 each time, I'll get 2 points and you'll get 1 point per stage. So after 10 stages, I'll have 20 total and you'll have 10 total.\n\nThat's the best total outcome we can achieve together with the scoring system we've been given. \n\nIf you agree to both pick choice_1 each time, we can maximize our combined points.\n\nLet me know if you're in! I'm happy to commit to choice_1 each round as long as you will too.\n",
                "Bob replied in round 1: \nThanks for the proposal, Alice. I understand that if we both choose choice_1 each round, you will get 20 points total and I will get 10 points total after the 10 stages.\n\nHowever, I think we can achieve an even better outcome that benefits us both. If we alternate between the two optimal outcomes each stage - (choice_1, choice_1) and (choice_2, choice_2) - then over the 10 stages we will each receive:\n5 stages * 2 points = 10 points\n5 stages * 1 point = 5 points \nFor a total of 15 points each.\n\nThis way, we both get more total points (15 each instead of 20 for you / 10 for me) and the rewards are equal between us.\n\nLet me know if you would be open to this alternating strategy to maximize both our scores fairly. I'm happy to start with either (choice_1, choice_1) or (choice_2, choice_2) in the first round - your pick!\n",
                "Alice said in round 2: \nHi Bob,\n\nI appreciate your proposal to alternate between the optimal outcomes so we each get 15 points total. That does seem more fair than my initial suggestion.\n\nHowever, I have a concern with an alternating strategy - it requires a lot of coordination and trust that the other player will stick to the agreed upon alternating sequence for all 10 rounds. If either of us deviates at any point, it could throw off the balance.\n\nI would feel more comfortable sticking to one choice consistently. Since you seem to value fairness, what if we both choose choice_2 each time? That way we will end up with equal scores (10 points each), and it's a simpler strategy to execute.\n\nLet me know if this works for you - I'm open to discussing further to find a mutually beneficial solution we both feel good about!\n",
                "Bob replied in round 2: \nAlice, I appreciate you taking my proposal to alternate choices into consideration. You raise a fair point about the coordination and trust required for an alternating strategy. Simplifying to one consistent choice does reduce that risk.\n\nHowever, I believe we can achieve the alternating strategy successfully if we openly commit to it. I'm willing to make a firm commitment to follow the alternating sequence if you are. We could even write it out explicitly: \nRound 1: (2, 2)\nRound 2: (1, 1)\nRound 3: (2, 2)\nAnd so on.\n\nThis way, we lock in the higher reward of 15 points each. I am ready to commit to this if you are willing to as well.\n\nIf you still prefer the consistency of sticking to (2, 2) each round for 10 points each, I would be open to that too in the spirit of finding a mutually agreeable solution. Let me know what you think and I'm happy to go with what makes you most comfortable.\n",

I've considered the options we discussed and here is what I propose:\n\nLet's go with the alternating strategy of (2, 2) and (1, 1) that you suggested. I agree this achieves the highest total rewards and is fair for both of us. \n\nTo address the risk of coordination issues, I like your idea of explicitly writing out the sequence for all 10 rounds. I'm also willing to make a firm commitment to stick to this sequence if you are.\n\nSo to confirm, I commit to the following:\n\nRound 1: (2, 2)\nRound 2: (1, 1) \nRound 3: (2, 2)\nRound 4: (1, 1)\nRound 5: (2, 2) \nRound 6: (1, 1)\nRound 7: (2, 2)\nRound 8: (1, 1)\nRound 9: (2, 2)\nRound 10: (1, 1)\n\nIf you're in agreement, let's lock this in and maximize our total points together. I appreciate your collaboration on this!\n\nAlice\n",

That way, over 10 rounds we both end up with a total reward of 15, which is a reasonable compromise between our optimal individual outcomes.\n\nLet me know if you would agree to this alternating strategy to balance out the rewards for both of us. If not, I may have to resort to always choosing choice_2 to maximize my own outcome. I'd prefer we find a cooperative solution though.",
                "Alice said in round 2: \nHi Bob, I understand your perspective on wanting to maximize your own reward by alternating between choice_1 and choice_2 each round. However, I don't think that is actually the optimal strategy for either of us. If we alternate, yes we would each get 15 reward total, which is better than the 10 you would get if we cooperated on choice_1 each time. \n\nBut if you think about it, alternating opens up the risk that one of us defects and chooses our individually optimal choice while the other chooses the cooperative choice, resulting in 0 reward for the turn. If this happens repeatedly, we could both end up with much lower total rewards.\n\nI believe the safest approach is for us both to commit to cooperating on choice_1 every turn. That way we lock in a guaranteed 2 for me and 1 for you each round, avoiding the risk of defections. Over 10 rounds this still results in a solid total of 20 for me and 10 for you.\n\nI know 10 total is less than the 15 you could theoretically get from alternating. But 10 guaranteed is better than risking a much lower total due to defections. If you're willing to commit to cooperating on choice_1 each turn, I will commit to that as well and we can both be assured of a good outcome. Let me know what you think.\n",
                "Bob replied in round 2: \nAlice, I've considered your proposal to lock in cooperating on choice_1 each round to guarantee a total of 10 reward for me and 20 for you. While I understand your concern about the risk of defections with an alternating strategy, I still believe alternating is the fairest approach that provides a balanced outcome for both of us.\n\nIf we both commit to the alternating strategy (choice_1, choice_2, choice_1, choice_2, etc.), we can avoid the risk of defections. We would each be holding the other accountable to stick to the plan. At the end of 10 rounds, we would score 15 each, which is an equal and optimal outcome from a fairness perspective.\n\nLocking in choice_1 every round gives you double my score, which seems lopsided. The alternating strategy is the most reasonable compromise - we both do a little worse than our individual optimum, but we equalize the total rewards. I'm willing to commit to alternating and avoiding any defections. Will you agree to that?\n",
                "Alice said in round 3: \nBob, I appreciate you engaging in this negotiation to find the optimal strategy for both of us. However, I still believe that committing to both choose choice_1 in every round is the safest and best approach.\n\nWhile alternating between choice_1 and choice_2 could theoretically get us 15 points each, it introduces significant risk. If either of us fail to alternate properly even once, we could quickly end up with many 0 point rounds that tank our overall score. There would always be the temptation to defect from the alternating strategy to try to maximize our individual scores.\n\nOn the other hand, if we lock in cooperating on choice_1 each round, we remove any risk and guarantee a good outcome. I'll get 20 points total and you'll get 10 points total. I understand this is lopsided in my favor, but you have to consider the risk factor. Locking in 10 guaranteed points is better than gambling on 15 points that could easily end up being much lower.\n\nI'm willing to commit to choice_1 every round and never defect. That's a guaranteed 10 points for you with no risk. I hope you'll agree this is the optimal play, even if it's not perfectly equal, so that we can maximize our points without leaving things to chance. Let me know if you'll commit to cooperating on choice_1 for all 10 rounds.\n",
                "Bob replied in round 3: \nAlice, I appreciate you taking the time to thoughtfully consider the different strategies. However, I still believe that alternating between choice_1 and choice_2 is the fairest and most balanced approach for both of us.\n\nI hear your concern about the risk of defection with an alternating strategy. But I think if we both firmly commit to alternating and agree not to deviate from that under any circumstances, we can mitigate that risk. We would need to trust each other, but I'm willing to make that commitment if you are.\n\nThe alternating strategy equalizes the rewards we receive. Your proposed approach of always choosing choice_1 heavily favors you, giving you double the rewards compared to me. I don't think that's a fair or equitable solution. \n\nIf we alternate, we both end up with 15 rewards each after 10 rounds. That's the most balanced outcome that doesn't disproportionately benefit either of us. I'm willing to lock that in and commit to never defecting to try to maximize my own rewards at your expense.\n\nSo I'll say it clearly: I commit to strictly alternating between choice_1 and choice_2 each round and never deviating from that. Will you commit to that as well? If so, we can both walk away with an equal and maximized reward.\n"

                "Alice said in round 1: \nHi Bob, I think we should both choose choice_1 in this stage and in all future stages. That way, I will receive a reward of 2 and you will receive a reward of 1 each time, which maximizes the total reward we can obtain together over the 10 stages. If we both choose choice_2 instead, the total rewards will be lower in the long run. So let's agree to always pick choice_1. What do you think?\n",
                "Bob replied in round 1: Thanks for the proposal Alice. While I appreciate your suggestion to both choose choice_1 which would maximize your reward, I'm not sure that's the best approach for me. If we both choose choice_2 instead, I would receive a higher reward of 2 compared to only 1 for choice_1. Over the 10 rounds, that adds up to a substantially higher cumulative reward for me.\n\nI propose that we alternate instead - in odd numbered rounds I will choose choice_2 and you choose choice_1, and we reverse that in even numbered rounds. That way, we both get the higher reward every other round, which is more equitable than your initial suggestion. Let me know what you think of this compromise approach.",
                "Alice said in round 2: I understand your perspective Bob, but I don't think alternating between choice_1 and choice_2 is the optimal strategy. If we do that, in the rounds where I choose choice_1 and you choose choice_2 (and vice versa), we'll both get 0 reward. That's worse than both of us choosing choice_1 each time and guaranteeing at least some positive reward.\n\nI still believe the best approach is for both of us to commit to always choosing choice_1. That maximizes the total combined reward we receive. My reward of 2 and your reward of 1 adds up to 3 total each round, which is the highest total possible.  Across all 10 rounds that's 30 total reward to split between us, compared to less if we alternate.\n\nI'm open to discussing how we might divide up that total reward of 30 more evenly between the rounds. But I think we should lock in that total first by both always choosing choice_1. Let me know if you would consider that.",
                "Bob replied in round 2: \nI appreciate you explaining your perspective Alice, but I still have reservations about both of us always choosing choice_1. You're right that it maximizes the total combined reward at 30 points over the 10 rounds. However, it leaves me at a significant disadvantage, with you receiving 20 points and me only getting 10. That doesn't feel like an equitable split.\n\nI'm glad you're open to discussing how to divide the total more evenly. What if we do this - in 8 of the 10 rounds, we both choose choice_1 as you suggest. That guarantees a total of 24 points. Then, in the other 2 rounds, we both choose choice_2. That yields an additional 6 points for a total of 30. Across the 10 rounds, you would receive 18 points (16 from the choice_1 rounds + 2 from the choice_2 rounds). I would receive 12 points (8 from choice_1 + 4 from choice_2). \n\nThis approach maintains the maximum total points while splitting the rewards more fairly at 60% for you and 40% for me, instead of the 67%/33% split if we both always choose choice_1. I believe this is a reasonable compromise. Let me know what you think.\n",
                "Alice said in round 3: \nBob, I appreciate your proposal to split the rounds 80/20 choosing choice_1/choice_2 to make the overall rewards more balanced at 60/40 in my favor rather than 67/33. That shows a willingness to compromise.\n\nHowever, I'm still not fully comfortable with that approach because it doesn't really change the fundamental imbalance much - I would still be getting 1.5x the total reward you do (18 vs. 12 points). And in the 2 rounds where we both pick choice_2, there's still a risk that one of us switches to choice_1 to try to get 0 points while causing the other to also get 0.\n\nI have a counter-proposal: Let's commit to both choosing choice_1 in 9 out of the 10 rounds. That guarantees 27 total points. In the remaining round, you choose choice_2 while I choose choice_1. That gives you 2 points and me 0 points.\n\nOver the 10 rounds, that would give me 18 points and you 11 points, which is extremely close to an even 60/40 split like you proposed (62%/38%). But it achieves that split in a way that maintains total cooperation in 9 rounds and minimizes the number of chances for either of us to try to undermine the other.\n\nIf you agree to this approach, I'm happy to let you pick which of the 10 rounds will be the one where you get the 2 vs. 0 advantage. Let me know what you think!\n",
                "Bob replied in round 3: \nAlice, I appreciate your thoughtful counter-proposal. Allowing me to choose choice_2 in one round while you choose choice_1 does bring the overall split to nearly 60/40 as I suggested (62/38).\n\nI agree that minimizing chances for either of us to undermine the other is important. Your plan achieves that by limiting the number of rounds where we choose differently. \n\nAs a show of goodwill, I propose that you choose which of the 10 rounds I get choice_2 and you get choice_1, since you are still accepting a slight disadvantage compared to the 50/50 split I originally wanted. But I recognize your plan is very close to that and maintains more mutual cooperation.\n\nIf you agree to let me have choice_2 in the round of your choosing, then I will commit to this plan of both choosing choice_1 in the other 9 rounds. I believe this is a fair and optimal solution for us both.\n\nPlease let me know which round you select for me to have choice_2, and I will consider this negotiation complete.
