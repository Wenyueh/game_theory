I believe this is the fairest way to divide the rewards between us while still maximizing the total. Let me know if you agree to this plan.",

While I appreciate you looking to maximize the total rewards, your plan gives you twice as many points as me in each round and overall. I don't believe that is a fair split. Instead, I propose we alternate - in stages 1 and 3, we both choose choice_2 giving me 2 points and you 1 point each time. And in stages 2 and 4, we both choose choice_1 giving you 2 points and me 1 point each time. This way we each get 6 total points, which is an even split of the maximum possible total of 12.
