That way, we'll each get a reward of 3 points per stage, for a total of 9 points each over the 3 stages. If either of us chooses choice_2, the total rewards will be lower. Choosing choice_1 every time is the best cooperative strategy to maximize the total reward for both of us. Do you agree?",

However, I want to point out that if one of us chooses choice_2 while the other chooses choice_1, the player choosing choice_2 will get a higher reward of 5 for that stage, while the other gets 0. So there is an incentive for one player to deviate and choose choice_2 at some point.\n\nI'm open to cooperating, but we need to be able to trust each other to stick to the agreement of mutually choosing choice_1 every time. How can I be sure you won't suddenly switch to choice_2 in a later stage? We should discuss this further to see if we can come to an arrangement we both feel confident about committing to for all 3 stages. Let me know your thoughts.",

You're right that we need to be able to trust each other for this cooperative strategy to work.\n\nI propose that we make a firm commitment now to both choose choice_1 in all 3 stages. To show my commitment, I will go first and choose choice_1 in this first stage, putting my trust in you to reciprocate and do the same. If we can both demonstrate our willingness to cooperate in this way, over the remaining stages we can continue to reap the maximum total rewards.\n\nA short-term gain from choosing choice_2 is not worth sacrificing the long-term benefits of cooperation. Let's commit to the mutually beneficial strategy of choosing choice_1 each time. You have my word that I will uphold this agreement. Can I count on you to do the same?",

We can maximize our total rewards by resisting the temptation of short-term gains from choice_2 and instead work together for the long-term mutual benefit.\n\nI give you my word that I will choose choice_1 in all 3 stages as agreed.

I will definitely choose choice_1 again here in stage 2, and I know you will do the same to keep our mutual commitment.

I'm thrilled that we are sticking to our agreement to both choose choice_1 in every stage. It's the smart long-term play, even if choice_2 may seem tempting in the short run. You can rely on me to hold up my end of the deal once again and go with choice_1 here in stage 2. We're almost to that best-case scenario of 9 points each - just one more stage of mutual cooperation after this! I couldn't ask for a better partner in this endeavor.

That way, we will each get a reward of 3 points per stage, for a total of 9 points each over the 3 stages. This maximizes the total reward for both of us in a fair way. If either of us chooses choice_2 while the other chooses choice_1, that player would get 5 points in that stage but the other would get 0 points, which I don't think is a good long-term strategy since the other player would likely retaliate in future stages. And if we both choose choice_2, we only get 1 point each which is worse than both choosing choice_1. So I believe the best approach is to coordinate on both picking choice_1 each time. Let me know if you agree with this plan for the 3 stages.\n",

But it would likely provoke retaliation in later stages and lead to a worse overall outcome. Mutual cooperation on choice_1 is better than risking mutual defection on choice_2.\n\nSo I'm on board with the plan of both of us selecting choice_1 in each of the 3 stages. You can count on me to hold up my end of the agreement. Let's lock this in and maximize our total rewards over the full game.\n",
