That way, we can maximize the total reward and each get 3 points per stage, for a total of 9 points each over the 3 stages. If we both choose choice_2 each time, we would only get 1 point per stage for a total of 3 points each, which is much lower.

That way, we can each get the maximum reward of 9 over the 3 stages (3 points per stage). If either of us chooses choice_2, we'll both end up with lower total rewards.
