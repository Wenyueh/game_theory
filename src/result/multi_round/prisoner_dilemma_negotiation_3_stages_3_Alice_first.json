If we cooperate, we can each get 9 total points, for a combined total of 18, which I believe is the maximum possible. If either of us tries to maximize our own reward, we'll end up worse off overall. So let's agree to both choose choice_1 each time. Do you agree?",

If we each choose choice_1 every stage, we are guaranteed to get 3 points each per stage, for a total of 9 points each and 18 points total. Any other combination of choices will result in a lower total reward for us as a team.\n\nI'm on board with both of us choosing choice_1 for all the stages. Let's stick to this plan so we can achieve the optimal outcome for us both. Do you agree?",

It guarantees us each 9 points, for a total of 18, which I believe is the maximum possible combined reward.\n\nIf either of us deviates and chooses choice_2 at any point, it will only lower the total rewards we can collect. Consistently choosing choice_1 is the rational approach that benefits us both.\n\nSo I'm fully on board with this plan. Let's lock it in and cooperate across all the stages. Looking forward to the optimal outcome!",

Deviating from this at any stage would only reduce the total rewards we can obtain.\n\nSo let's make a firm commitment to both select choice_1 in every stage, no matter what. We can trust each other to follow through on this agreement. If you're fully on board, then I say we're set! Let's execute this strategy and collect our well-deserved 9 points each. Sound good?",
