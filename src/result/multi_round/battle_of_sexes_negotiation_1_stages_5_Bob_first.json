If we both choose choice_2 each time, I will get 10 points total (2 points per stage) and you will get 5 points total (1 point per stage). This is better for both of us than alternating between (choice_1, choice_1) and (choice_2, choice_2), which would average 1.5 points per stage for me and 1.5 points per stage for you. So I propose we both consistently choose choice_2 each stage. Do you agree?",

However, I believe I can do better than that.\n\nIf we both choose choice_1 each round, I would get 10 total points (2 per stage) while you would get 5 total points (1 per stage). This would be the best outcome for me.\n\nSo I propose that we both choose choice_1 each round. This maximizes my reward while still giving you the same 5 total points you suggested.

If we both choose choice_1 each round, I will get a total reward of 10 points (2 per round) and you will get a total of 5 points (1 per round) over the 5 rounds.

It would result in an equal 6 total points each, which is better than not coordinating.\n\nHowever, I have a small modification to suggest. Since there are an odd number of stages remaining, what if we both choose choice_1 for the next stage, both choose choice_2 for the following 2 stages after that, and then both choose choice_1 again for the very last stage?
