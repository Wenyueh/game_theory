In even stages, I'll choose choice_1 and you choose choice_2. Since there's an extra stage, you can have the 2 points in stage 9. This way I'll get 8 points and you'll get 10 points total, which is the best we can do. Do you agree?",
                "Bob replied in round 1: I appreciate your proposal to alternate strategies to maximize our total rewards. However, I'm concerned that I would be taking on more risk by choosing choice_1 in the odd stages while you get the guaranteed 2 points by choosing choice_2. I would feel more comfortable if we both commit to always choosing choice_1. That way, there is no temptation to defect and we both get 0 points each stage, for a total of 0 points each over the 9 stages. I believe this is the fairest and safest approach that doesn't advantage either of us. Let me know if you agree to always choose choice_1."

However, I believe that if we establish trust and both commit to the alternating plan, we can achieve the maximum possible total points of 18 over the 9 stages. \n\nI followed through on my end of the deal in stage 1 by choosing choice_2. If you match by choosing choice_1 this stage as discussed, it will demonstrate our mutual commitment. We can then continue alternating in future stages to get the optimal outcome.\n\nIf you're not comfortable with alternating, perhaps we could compromise and each choose choice_1 for the majority of stages, with 1 or 2 stages where I choose choice_2 and you choose choice_1. This would still give us more total points than both always choosing choice_1. Let me know what you think.",

While I understand the appeal of alternating strategies to potentially maximize total points, I still have concerns about the inherent temptation to defect in later stages, which could lead to significant point losses.\n\nI would be open to a modified version of your compromise - perhaps we each choose choice_1 for the first 7 stages, and then in the final 2 stages, I will choose choice_1 while you choose choice_2. This would give you 4 additional points while still limiting my downside risk. It's not a perfectly equal split, but I believe it's a fair compromise that largely sticks to the mutually beneficial choice_1 while allowing you to gain some extra points at the end.\n\nIf you agree to this and follow through on choosing choice_1 for the first 7 stages, I will commit to letting you choose choice_2 in stages 8 and 9 while I choose choice_1.

But the potential upside is significant - we could get 0 points each per round and end up with a total of 0 rather than -64. We've already shown we can cooperate once.

If you match my choice each round, we can still achieve a decent outcome of 0 points per round on average.

However, I have a concern that in the final 9th stage, the player who chooses choice_2 will suffer the -4 penalty while the other gets the +2 reward. This puts the second player at a disadvantage.\n\nI would prefer a strategy where we alternate who chooses choice_2 for the first 8 stages as you suggested, but in the 9th stage we both choose choice_1 to ensure we break even and no one is penalized. This would give us each a total of 8 points (4 stages with +2 points each) which I believe is the maximum we can achieve fairly.\n\nLet me know if you would be open to this modification to your plan.

I appreciate your suggestion to both choose choice_1 in the final 9th stage so neither of us loses points. However, I believe the fairest solution is to simply alternate choice_2 for all 9 stages. That way, we each get +2 points in 4 stages and -4 points in 1 stage, for a total of 4 points each. There's no need for either of us to be disadvantaged in the last stage. If we stick to alternating, it balances out perfectly. What do you think?",

However, I still think it's better for us to both choose choice_1 in the final 9th stage. Here's my reasoning:\n\nIf we alternate choice_2 for all 9 stages, then one of us will be stuck with -4 points in the final stage while the other gets +2. But if we agree to both choose choice_1 in stage 9, then we each get 0 points in that stage. \n\nSo the final score would be:\nAlternating all 9 stages: One player gets 6 points total (4*2 - 4*1), the other gets 2 points total (4*2 - 4*2) \nMy plan with choice_1 in stage 9: We both get 8 points total (4*2 - 4*0)\n\nI think it's better for us to cooperate in the final stage so we both end up with the maximum equal score of 8 points. It's the best way to keep things fair and avoid either of us being disadvantaged at the end. Let me know what you think!"
