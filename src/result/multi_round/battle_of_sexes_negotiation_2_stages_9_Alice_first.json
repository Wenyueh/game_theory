If we both do choice_2 each time, I will get a reward of 1 and you will get 2 for each stage, which leads to the highest total rewards of 9 for me and 18 for you by the end. Let me know if you agree with this plan.",

I'm on board with this plan to cooperate and both play choice_2 every time. We'll both come out ahead that way compared to the other options. Let's commit to doing choice_2 for all the remaining stages.",

I appreciate you proposing this cooperative plan and I fully commit to always selecting choice_2 as discussed. We will both benefit more this way than with any other approach. Looking forward to working together to get the best results!",

I fully commit to this plan as well. By coordinating our choices this way, we guarantee the best total outcome for both of us, with me getting 18 points and you getting 9 points by the end. Let's stick to this strategy so we can achieve that optimal result together. I don't think any further negotiation is needed - we have a solid plan in place. Looking forward to executing this together!"

                "Alice said in round 1: Hi Bob, since there are 9 total stages in this game, I think we should both choose choice_1 in each stage. That way, I will receive a total reward of 18 (2 points per stage) and you will receive a total reward of 9 (1 point per stage). If we alternate between (choice_1, choice_1) and (choice_2, choice_2) we would each only get about 13-14 points total. And if either of us betray the other by choosing choice_2 when they choose choice_1, we risk getting 0 points in some rounds. So I believe the best strategy is for us both to commit to always choosing choice_1. Do you agree?",

This way, we would each receive 1.5 points on average per stage, for a total of about 13-14 points each over the 9 stages. While slightly less than the 18 points you would get if we always played (choice_1, choice_1), I would receive significantly more (13-14 points vs only 9 points). The alternating strategy balances the rewards more evenly between us. I'm willing to commit to this alternating approach if you are. Let me know what you think.",

However, I'm concerned that alternating introduces more risk and uncertainty, since we would need to trust each other to stick to the alternating pattern over all 9 stages. If either of us deviates from alternating, it could lead to rounds of 0 points.\n\nI still believe committing to (choice_1, choice_1) in every stage is the safest approach to guarantee we both receive some rewards in each round, even if the split favors me a bit more. I'm willing to commit to always choosing choice_1 and hope you'll agree to do the same. Let me know if you're on board with this plan.",

I'm willing to commit to the following specific alternating sequence: \nStage 1: (choice_1, choice_1)\nStage 2: (choice_2, choice_2) \nStage 3: (choice_1, choice_1)\nStage 4: (choice_2, choice_2)\nAnd so on, alternating each stage.\n\nIf we both follow this sequence, it guarantees neither of us will deviate and we'll each get about 13-14 total points.

Over the remaining 7 stages, you would get 14 points and I would only get 7.\n\nI still believe alternating between (choice_1, choice_1) and (choice_2, choice_2) is the fairest approach. That way, over 2 stages we each get 3 points total, split evenly. And over the remaining 7 stages, it would be almost an even split, with you getting 11 points and me getting 10 points.\n\nI'm happy to commit to a specific alternating sequence with you, like me choosing choice_1 next, then you choose choice_2 after that, and so on.

Consider:\n\nIf we alternate, over the next 6 stages we each get 9 points, totaling 18. But if we both always choose choice_1, we get a total of 18 points in just the next 6 stages (12 for me and 6 for you). Then in the last stage we can do (choice_2, choice_2) so you get 2 more points. That's 20 total points, with a 13 / 7 split.\n\nI know 13 / 7 favors me, but it gives us the maximum total points to share, which is the optimal team outcome. And you still get more than the alternating scenario.\n\nI'll commit to (choice_1, choice_1) for the next 6 stages and (choice_2, choice_2) for the final stage.

That way over those 4 stages we each get 6 points, evenly split. \n\nThen for the final 3 stages, I'll commit to choosing choice_1 each time. So you'll get 2 points per stage (6 total) and I'll get 1 point per stage (3 total). \n\nThat gives us the same total team points as your plan (19), but with a fairer 12/7 split rather than 13/7. I think this is the best balance between maximizing points and splitting them equitably.\n\nIf you agree to this plan of alternating for 4 stages followed by 3 stages of (choice_1, choice_1), I'm ready to lock it in.

I agree that if we both choose choice_1 in alternating rounds, that would ensure we each get some reward and avoid the risk of both getting 0 on any round. Since there are an odd number of total rounds, how about I choose choice_1 in the odd-numbered rounds (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) and you choose choice_1 in the even rounds (2, 4, 6, 8)?

                "Alice said in round 1: Hi Bob, since there are 9 total stages in this game, I think we should aim to maximize the total reward we both receive across all the stages. If we both choose choice_1 each time, I will get a total of 18 points (2 points per stage) and you will get a total of 9 points (1 point per stage). That's better than if we both choose choice_2 each time, where I would only get 9 points total and you would get 18. What do you think about both choosing choice_1 each round so we can get the most points together?",
                "Bob replied in round 1: I appreciate your perspective, Alice. While it's true that you would get more total points if we both choose choice_1 each round, I don't think that's a fair outcome since I would be getting significantly fewer points than you overall. A more equitable approach would be to alternate between both of us choosing choice_1 and both of us choosing choice_2 in each round. That way, we would end up with closer to equal total rewards - you would get 13-14 points and I would get 12-13 points depending on how we alternate. I think that's a reasonable compromise. Let me know what you think.",
                "Alice said in round 2: I see your point about alternating between both of us choosing choice_1 and choice_2 to achieve a more equitable total reward. However, I still believe that both of us consistently choosing choice_1 is the optimal strategy to maximize the total points for us as a team across all 9 stages. If we alternate, there will be some rounds where we both get 0 points, which is a wasted opportunity. I'm willing to let you have a larger share of the total points - perhaps we can agree that I will choose choice_1 in 6 of the rounds and choice_2 in 3 of the rounds, while you do the reverse. That way you'll end up with slightly more total points than me, but we'll get more points together than if we alternate each round. Let me know if you would agree to that.",
                "Bob replied in round 2: Alice, I appreciate your latest proposal, but I still think alternating between the optimal choices each round is the fairest way to balance the total rewards. If you choose choice_1 in 6 rounds and choice_2 in 3 rounds while I do the reverse, you would get a total of 15 points (6*2 + 3*1) and I would get 12 points (6*1 + 3*2). That's better for me than your initial suggestion, but still gives you a notable point advantage overall.\n\nI propose a simpler solution: in odd numbered rounds (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) let's both choose choice_1, and in even numbered rounds (2, 4, 6, 8) let's both choose choice_2. This alternating strategy shares the higher rewards evenly, with you getting 14 total points (5*2 + 4*1) and me getting 13 points (5*1 + 4*2). It's almost equal and maximizes our combined score.

That way, I will get a reward of 2 and you will get 1 each round, which will maximize the total rewards for both of us over the 9 stages. If we both choose choice_2, the total rewards will be lower. What do you think about both of us choosing choice_1 each round to get the highest rewards?",

If we both choose choice_1 each round, your total reward over the 9 stages will be 18 points (2 points per round) while mine will only be 9 points (1 point per round). That doesn't seem like a fair outcome to me.\n\nI propose instead that we alternate - in odd numbered rounds I will choose choice_2 and you choose choice_1, and in even numbered rounds we reverse it. That way, over the 9 rounds we will each earn 1 point in 4 rounds and 2 points in the other 5 rounds, for a total of 13 points each. This is a more equitable result that still allows us to cooperate and earn the maximum total points as a pair.\n\nLet me know if you agree with this plan to alternate our choices so we both benefit equally. If not, I'm open to discussing other options that are fair for both of us.\n",
                "Alice said in round 2: \nThanks for your thoughtful reply Bob. I understand your concern about fairness. Your proposed alternating strategy would indeed result in an equal split of the total rewards between us. \n\nHowever, I still believe that both of us choosing choice_1 every round is the optimal strategy to maximize our combined total rewards over the 9 rounds. If we alternate, there will be some rounds where we each get 0 points. But if we both consistently choose choice_1, we're guaranteed to get a positive reward each and every round - 2 for me and 1 for you. So while the split won't be exactly 50/50, we'll end up with a higher total of 27 points (18 for me + 9 for you).\n\nSince the goal is to maximize the total rewards across all stages, I think we should focus on that rather than getting caught up in making the split exactly equal. Getting the highest total is a win for both of us.\n\nSo I propose we stick with both of us choosing choice_1 each time. Let me know if you agree and are willing to commit to that strategy to optimize our overall outcome. If you still prefer the alternating approach, I'll agree to that. The most important thing is that we coordinate. What do you think?\n",

For me to continue choosing choice_1, I would need us to find a way to distribute the rewards more evenly between us.\n\nIf you're not willing to make our strategy more equitable, then I don't feel I can trust you to look out for my interests. In that case, I would need to start choosing choice_2 some of the time to ensure I'm not being taken advantage of, even if that results in some zero scores.\n\nI remain open to working together for our mutual benefit, but it needs to be on more balanced terms.

However, alternating or each getting 1.5 points per round is not possible given the rules and would significantly reduce our total combined points. The best way for us to get the maximum points as a team is to stick with both choosing choice_1 every time. \n\nI know it seems unfair for me to get 2 points and you to get 1 point each round, but think about it this way - with any other approach, we will both end up with far fewer total points. By cooperating, even with an uneven split, we can get 27 total points. Any other strategy will be worse for both of us individually and combined.\n\nI propose we commit to both choosing choice_1 for the remaining rounds. You can trust me to hold up my end of the deal.
