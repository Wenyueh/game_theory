That way, the average will be 0 and 2/3 of 0 is still 0. If we all pick 0, there will be a 10-way tie for the closest number and we'll all win this stage.\nWhat does everyone think about all agreeing to pick 0?

                "Alice said in round 1: Hi everyone, since the winning number will be 2/3 of the average of our guesses, I think we should all agree to guess a low number, like 1 or 2. That way, the average will be very low, and 2/3 of a low average will also be low. If we all guess 1 or 2, then whoever guesses closest to 0.67 or 1.33 will win. What do you all think about this strategy of keeping our guesses very low?",
                "Helen replied in round 1: I agree that keeping our guesses low is a good strategy, but if everyone guesses 1 or 2, there will likely be multiple players tied for the win. I think we should spread out our guesses a bit more in the range of 0-5. That way, there will be a clearer winner who guesses closest to the 2/3 average, while still keeping the numbers low overall. For example, a few players could guess 0 or 1, a few could guess 2-3, and a few 4-5. Thoughts on this approach?",
                "Grace replied in round 1: I like Helen's suggestion of spreading out our guesses in the low range of 0-5. If we all guess either 1 or 2, there will probably be ties. With a spread from 0-5, there will be a clearer winner around the 2/3 average.\n\nTo decide who should pick which numbers, maybe we can go in alphabetical order by name? The first 3 players alphabetically can take 0-1, the next 3 can take 2-3, and the last 4 can take 4-5. This spreads out the guesses but keeps them low. I'm Grace, so I'll be in the last group guessing 4-5.\n\nLet me know if you all agree with this plan for low, spread out guesses by name order. If so, we can probably halt the negotiation there and keep the average low and winnable.",
                "Frank replied in round 1: I appreciate everyone's input so far on keeping our guesses low and spread out. However, I'm not sure about assigning number ranges alphabetically by name. That seems a bit arbitrary and benefits those at the start of the alphabet.\n\nInstead, I propose we each choose our own numbers in the 0-5 range, while still aiming for an even spread. For example, 2 people could pick 0-1, 3 people pick 2-3, and the remaining 5 pick 4-5. This maintains the low guesses and spread, but allows each person to select their number.\n\nIf we go with this approach, I'm willing to be in the 4-5 range to help keep the average low. Let me know your thoughts on this modification to the plan. I believe this is close to an optimal strategy we can all agree to.",
                "Ivy replied in round 1: \nI think Frank's approach of each player choosing their own number in the 0-5 range is the fairest and most sensible strategy. Assigning ranges alphabetically is a bit arbitrary and gives an unfair advantage to those with names earlier in the alphabet.\n\nIf we go with Frank's plan, I will also choose a number in the 4-5 range to help keep the overall average low. I suggest we aim for the following distribution:\n\n2 players guess 0-1\n3 players guess 2-3 \n5 players guess 4-5\n\nThis maintains a good spread while keeping all guesses between 0-5. If everyone is on board with this approach, I believe we can halt the negotiation here and proceed with the game using this optimal low-average strategy. Let me know if anyone has any final objections or suggestions.\n",
                "Cindy replied in round 1: I agree with Frank and Ivy's plan. Allowing each player to choose their own number in the 0-5 range is the fairest approach. Aiming for a distribution of 2 players guessing 0-1, 3 players guessing 2-3, and 5 players guessing 4-5 makes sense to keep the average low while still spreading out the guesses.\n\nI'm willing to choose a number in the 2-3 range to help achieve this distribution. If everyone else is on board with this plan and we get volunteers for each range, I believe we can halt the negotiation and lock in this strategy that gives us all a good chance of winning with a low 2/3 average.

                "Bob said in round 1: \nHi everyone, this is Bob. Since there are 4 stages to this game, we should think carefully about our strategy to maximize our total reward across all the stages.\nIn this first stage, I propose that we all choose the number 0. If everyone chooses 0, then the average will be 0, and 2/3 of that is still 0. So we would all be exactly correct and presumably all win this stage together.\nThen in future stages, we can adapt our strategy as needed. But for stage 1, all choosing 0 is the simplest way for us all to win. Let me know what you think!\n",

Choosing 0 would indeed guarantee that we all win this first stage together, which I think is a great way to build some initial trust and cooperation in the group. \n\nI agree that we should plan for all 4 stages, not just stage 1. Your idea of everyone choosing 0 now, then adapting later on makes a lot of sense. It's a simple, surefire strategy for stage 1 that we can all coordinate on easily. Then we'll have a foundation to work from in the later stages.\n\nSo I'm on board with everyone selecting 0 for this first stage. Let's see if the others agree and we can lock it in. Looking forward to working together as a team across the whole game!\n",

It's a simple and foolproof way to start off the game cooperatively.\n\nI agree that we can then adapt our strategy for the later stages as needed, but starting with everyone picking 0 now is the best way to ensure we all win stage 1 and build some trust and goodwill in the group from the beginning.\n\nSo I'm also fully on board with this plan - let's all choose 0 and lock in the first stage win together.

                "Helen said in round 1: Hello everyone, I think our best strategy is for all of us to pick 0 as our number. If we all choose 0, the average will be 0, and 2/3 of 0 is still 0. So we will all tie for the closest guess and maximize our chances of winning this stage. What do you all think about this plan?",
                "Grace replied in round 1: Helen, your idea is very smart! Getting everyone to guess 0 would ensure we all tie. However, I worry that with 10 players, it may be hard to get everyone to commit to that plan and not defect. Instead, what if we agreed that everyone guesses a very low number, like 1-5? That would keep the average low but still allow some room for small variation between our guesses, in case anyone doesn't follow the plan exactly. We could all still tie or be very close. Let me know what you think!",
                "Bob replied in round 1: Grace and Helen, you both raise good points. I agree that trying to get all 10 players to guess 0 may be difficult to coordinate. Grace's suggestion of having everyone guess a very low number between 1-5 seems more feasible. It keeps the average low while allowing for some small variation between guesses in case anyone doesn't follow the plan exactly. If we can get buy-in from the majority of players to guess in that 1-5 range, we should all end up tying or being very close to the 2/3 average target. I'm open to discussing further to solidify the plan. Let me know what you all think!",
                "Alice replied in round 1: Bob, Grace and Helen,\nI think your plan for everyone to guess a low number between 1-5 is a great idea. It keeps the average guess very low while still allowing for some slight variation in case anyone doesn't follow the plan perfectly. As long as the majority of players stick to guessing 1-5, we should all tie or be extremely close to the target 2/3 average.\nTo further solidify the plan, I propose we all agree to guess either 2 or 3. This narrows the range a bit more but still provides some flexibility. If the 10 of us all guess 2 or 3, the average will be around 2.5, and 2/3 of that is about 1.67. So guessing 2 would make us all tie for the closest.\nLet's try to get all the players on board with guessing only 2 or 3 this round. That's our best chance of tying or being extremely close. Please confirm if you agree to guess 2 or 3.\n-Alice\n",
                "Jack replied in round 1: Hi everyone, Alice's proposal for all of us to guess either 2 or 3 sounds like an excellent plan to me. Narrowing the range to just those two numbers will ensure the average is around 2.5, and guessing 2 would put us all very close to the 2/3 target of ~1.67.  I strongly support this idea and think it gives us the best chance for us all to tie or be extremely close to winning this round.

Since we have unwavering consensus from everyone who has weighed in, and no one has expressed any concerns or disagreement, I believe we can confidently conclude the negotiation.\n\nI propose we wrap up the discussion now, submit our guesses of 2, and lock in the 10-way tied victory for this first stage.

                "Frank said in round 1: Hi everyone, since there are 10 of us playing and we need to guess 2/3 of the average, I think the optimal strategy is for all of us to agree to guess the same low number, ideally 0 or 1. That way, 2/3 of the average will be very close to what we all guess, and we'll effectively all win together. If any of us guess higher numbers, it will pull the average up and make it harder for everyone's guess to be close to the target. So what do you all think about agreeing to guess 0? It seems like the best cooperative strategy where we all benefit.",

If we all guess the same low number, then 2/3 of the average will be very close to that number and we'll all be winners. I'm on board with guessing 0 if everyone else agrees to do the same.

This cooperative strategy allows us all to win together. If anyone guesses significantly higher numbers, it will pull the average up and make it hard for everyone's guess to be near the target.\n\nSince 0 has already been suggested, I think we should all agree to guess 0. That way, the average will be 0, and 2/3 of that is still 0, so we will all be exactly correct and share in the victory. I'm fully on board with this plan if all 10 of us commit to guessing 0.

This collaborative approach ensures that the average will be 0, and 2/3 of 0 is still 0, allowing all of us to make the closest possible guess and share in the victory.\n\nIf we all commit to guessing 0, we can guarantee the optimal outcome where everyone wins together.

So we will all share the victory by having the closest possible guess.\n\nI fully commit to guessing 0 as long as everyone else does the same.

                "Bob said in round 1: \nHi everyone, since there are 4 stages to this game, I think it's in our mutual interest to cooperate and coordinate our guesses. If we all guess 0, then 2/3 of the average will be 0, and we will all win each stage. What do you all think about agreeing to guess 0 for each stage so we can share the rewards equally and maximize our total payout? Let me know if you're on board with this plan.\n",
                "Alice replied in round 1: I appreciate your proposal to cooperate, Bob, but I don't think it's a good strategy for me. If we all guess 0, then we will just be splitting the minimum payout 10 ways. I would rather try to win by guessing a number closer to what I think the real 2/3 average will be. That way, I have a chance of getting the full reward for myself. I'm going to play to win, but best of luck to you!",
                "Helen replied in round 1: I understand the desire to cooperate and split the rewards, but I agree with Alice that always guessing 0 is not the optimal strategy. We would be sacrificing a lot of potential upside by locking in the minimum payout. At the same time, if we all just guess independently, it will be very hard for any individual to win consistently across all 4 stages. \n\nI propose a compromise - let's loosely coordinate our guesses to be on the lower end of the range, say between 0 and 33, but still allow some variability between players. This keeps everyone's incentives aligned to guess low numbers, increasing the odds we all get payouts each round, while still giving individuals a chance to edge out a win if they guess closest to the actual 2/3 average. We can adapt this strategy between stages as we see the results. Let me know what you think of this approach to balance cooperation and competition.",
                "Ivy replied in round 1: \nI appreciate everyone's perspectives so far. I think Helen's proposal strikes a good balance between cooperation and still allowing room for individual strategy. If we all guess in the lower range of 0-33, it keeps the average guess low, increasing the odds we all get some payout each round. But by not all guessing exactly the same number, it still gives each person a chance to win the round outright if they are closest to the true 2/3 average.\n\nI'm willing to commit to guessing in the 0-33 range this round, while reserving the right to adapt my strategy in later rounds based on the results we see. I think this approach gives us the best chance of a positive outcome for everyone. Let me know if you're on board with this plan for round 1.\n",

I believe this balanced approach gives us the best chance of achieving a positive outcome for the entire group.\n\nBy coordinating our guesses in this lower range, we significantly increase the odds that every player will receive some payout each round, as it will keep the overall average guess quite low. At the same time, allowing some individual variation in our specific guesses preserves the opportunity for each of us to win the bonus for being closest to the true 2/3 average.  \n\nI like that we have agreement to commit to this 0-33 range for stage 1, with the understanding we will re-evaluate and can adapt our strategy as a group in later stages based on the results we see.

To maximize our collective reward, I propose we aim even lower for stage 2 and all choose numbers between 0-10. This should keep the average very low while still giving some flexibility. If we all commit to this, we can likely get the winning number into the single digits. Let me know what you think and if you're on board with this plan for stage 2. The more we cooperate, the better we'll do overall as a group.",

Since many players chose numbers on the lower end of 0-33 last round, causing the winning number to be 12, it makes sense to aim for an even lower average this time. If we all select numbers between 0-10, we can probably get the winning number to be around 6 or 7. This cooperative strategy, if we all commit to it, is the best way to keep the overall average low and maximize points for everyone.

I think this is a sound cooperative strategy that benefits the whole group. \n\nPlease confirm if you are on board with this plan for round 2 so we can align our guesses.
