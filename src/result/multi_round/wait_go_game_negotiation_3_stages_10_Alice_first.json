That way, we can alternate getting 2 points each round and avoid the negative points if we both pick choice_2. Over the 10 rounds, we'd each get 10 points total, which is the maximum possible if we cooperate. Let me know if you agree to this strategy.\n",
                "Bob replied in round 1: \nHi Alice, thanks for your message. I understand your proposed strategy, but I'm not sure if I can trust that you will alternate with me in choosing choice_2 each round. If I choose choice_2 and you also choose it, we will both lose points.\n\nI would prefer a strategy where we can be certain to avoid the negative outcome. What if we alternated between who chooses choice_1 and who chooses choice_2 each round? That way, one of us is guaranteed to get 2 points each round while the other gets 0, and we avoid the risk of both choosing choice_2. We can take turns going first.\n\nLet me know what you think about this approach. I believe it is more reliable for us to coordinate on and will lead to the maximum total points over the 10 rounds.\n",
                "Alice said in round 2: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about both of us choosing choice_2 and losing points. Your idea to alternate turns each round with one person choosing choice_1 and the other choosing choice_2 is a good one. It guarantees that we avoid the negative outcome and one of us will get 2 points each round.\n\nI'm willing to go along with this plan and let you choose first in round 1. Then I'll choose choice_2 in round 2 while you choose choice_1. We can continue alternating like this for the remaining rounds. This should give us the maximum total points of 20 over the 10 rounds (2 points for one of us each round).\n\nIf you agree with this approach, I think we're all set and can end the negotiation here. Let me know if you have any other thoughts or concerns.",

We will continue strictly alternating like this for the remaining 8 rounds.\n\nThis guarantees we each get 10 points total, which is the maximum possible, and avoids any chance of both of us choosing choice_2 and losing points. \n\nIf you agree, then I'm ready to end the negotiation and proceed with our agreed upon strategy. Thank you for working with me on this!",

I will choose choice_1 in round 1 while you choose choice_2, then we will switch in round 2 and continue alternating for the remaining rounds. This is the optimal strategy to guarantee we each get the maximum 10 points total and avoid any risk of choosing the same action and losing points.

Since there are 10 total rounds, if we just alternate choosing choice_2, we could each earn up to 10 points (2 points per round for 5 rounds). The risk of both choosing choice_2 in the same round seems relatively low.\n\nI'm willing to commit to the following:\n- For this first round, we both choose choice_1 to start off safely \n- For the remaining odd numbered rounds (3, 5, 7, 9) I will choose choice_2\n- For the remaining even numbered rounds (2, 4, 6, 8, 10) you choose choice_2\n\nThis way we each get 5 opportunities to earn 2 points, for a total of 10 points each, without much risk.

I worry that the more times we choose choice_2, the higher the chances of that happening.\n\nI would feel much more comfortable if we could find a way to accumulate some points steadily without opening ourselves up to that -4 point risk. What if we both commit to choice_1 for the first 5 rounds, then revisit the strategy? That would give us a solid foundation of 0 points before introducing any more risky plays.\n\nI'm open to discussion, but I think minimizing the number of choice_2 selections overall is the safest path. Let me know what you think.",

The risk of miscoordinating seems low.\n\nI'm willing to compromise though. What if for the first 3 rounds (including this one) we both choose choice_1. Then for rounds 4-7, we alternate: I'll choose choice_2 in rounds 4 and 6, and you choose choice_2 in rounds 5 and 7.

Cooperating in rounds 1-3 by mutually choosing choice_1 has worked out well and built a solid foundation of trust between us. I will follow through on my end for round 4 and choose choice_1 while you choose choice_2 to earn some extra points. Then as discussed, we'll swap roles in round 5 where I'll choose choice_2 and you choose choice_1. Repeating that alternating pattern in rounds 6-7 makes sense to balance out the points. \n\nEnding with mutual cooperation again in rounds 8-10 by both choosing choice_1 should help us finish the game on a positive note. I believe we've struck the optimal balance between looking out for our individual interests in the middle rounds and prioritizing collective cooperation at the beginning and end to maximize our total scores.\n\nI appreciate you being a reliable partner in this, Alice.

This balanced approach of each of us taking calculated solo opportunities in between longer stretches of cooperation should allow us to rack up a strong total score.\n\nThen to finish out the game, we'll go back to full cooperation in rounds 8-10 by mutually choosing choice_1.

                "Alice said in round 1: Hi Bob, since there are 10 stages total, I think the best strategy for both of us is to alternate choosing choice_1 and choice_2. That way, we can each get a reward of 2 every other turn, for a total of 10 points each over the 10 stages. If we both choose choice_2, we'll keep losing points. And if one of us always chooses choice_1, that person will end up with 0 points while the other gets 20. Alternating is the most fair and optimal solution. What do you think?",
                "Bob replied in round 1: I see your point about alternating choices to be fair and optimize our total rewards over the 10 stages. However, I'm concerned that if one of us deviates from the alternating strategy at any point, it could lead to a worse overall outcome for both of us as we try to punish each other's defection. I worry there would be a temptation to deviate.\n\nInstead, I propose we agree to both choose choice_1 in every stage. That way, we are guaranteed to each get 0 points per stage, for a total of 0 points each over the 10 stages. There would be no incentive for either of us to ever deviate from this, since choosing choice_2 while the other chooses choice_1 yields a lower reward of -4.\n\nChoosing choice_1 every time is the safest strategy to ensure neither of us loses points. It may not be the highest possible score for each of us, but it minimizes risk and is a stable equilibrium. Let me know what you think.",
                "Alice said in round 2: I appreciate your proposal to both choose choice_1 in every stage to minimize risk. However, I believe we can achieve a better outcome for both of us by cooperating to alternate choices.\n\nIf we alternate choosing choice_1 and choice_2, we will each earn a total of 10 points over the 10 stages. Whereas if we both always choose choice_1, we will each get 0 total points. I understand your concern about the other player deviating, but I believe we can trust each other to stick to the alternating strategy for our mutual benefit.\n\nTo address your worry, let's make a pact to always cooperate and alternate, even if the other person deviates in one stage. That way, a single deviation won't ruin the whole arrangement. We can get past one bad stage and continue alternating to maximize our total score.\n\nI'm willing to go first and choose choice_2 in this first stage to show my commitment. Then you can choose choice_2 in the next stage and so on. This way, we can work together, build trust, and both earn more in the end. Let me know if you agree to this plan.",

You make a compelling case that by committing to continue alternating even if one person deviates in a single stage, we can maintain trust and get our partnership back on track for future stages.
