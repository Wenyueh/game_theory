That way, we can maximize the total reward and each get 3 points per round, for a total of 9 points each over the 3 stages. If we both choose choice_2, we'll only get 1 point each per round, or 3 points total. And if one of us tries to get 5 points by choosing choice_2 while the other chooses choice_1, it will likely lead to retaliation in future rounds and lower rewards overall. So cooperating on choice_1 is the optimal long-term strategy to maximize our total payouts. Let me know if you agree to both play choice_1 each round.",

Sustained cooperation is in both our best interests.\n\nSo I'm willing to commit to choosing choice_1 each round, as long as you will too. If we can make that pact, we'll both come out ahead.

I agree this would maximize our total rewards if we can trust each other to follow through. However, in any single stage, one of us would be tempted to defect and choose choice_2 to get 5 points while the other gets 0. How can we be sure the other won't give in to that temptation? I'm open to cooperating, but we need a way to ensure mutual trust and commitment. Do you have any ideas?

To maximize our total rewards over all 3 stages, I still believe our best strategy is to continue cooperating and both choose choice_1 in the remaining stages.

And if one of us defects while the other cooperates, it unfairly rewards the defector. Consistently choosing choice_1 is the only way we both come out ahead.\n\nTo show my commitment, I promise I will choose choice_1 in this stage and the next.

You've shown integrity with your actions so far and assurances for the future.\n\nTherefore, I agree to continue our cooperative strategy and also choose choice_1 in this stage and the last one. Let's hold true to this plan and each earn the maximum 9 points over the 3 stages. We can achieve the optimal outcome through mutual trust and a focus on long-term results over short-term temptations.\n"
