I think Alice's proposal of agreeing on a number in the 20-30 range is a reasonable compromise.

That way, the average will be 10, and the target will be 6.67. By all choosing the same number slightly above 0, we reduce the incentive to defect, while still keeping the numbers low so we all score well. \n\nI followed through on our agreement to cooperate last round, so I hope you will work with me again in this final stage so we can all succeed together.

It keeps the target number low at 6.67 so we all stand to gain a good amount of points, while reducing the temptation to defect compared to all choosing 0.\n\nHowever, to build even more certainty, I propose we each choose 12 instead of 10. That would make the average 12 and the target number 8. This is a bit higher than 6.67, but still quite low. By choosing a number slightly above the 10 we discussed, it removes almost all incentive for any one of us to defect and try to hit 8 exactly, since going above 12 would be too risky.\n\nI apologize for choosing 24 last round while you both cooperated. Let me make it up to you now by proposing and committing to this plan of 12. I hope you'll join me in choosing 12 so we can lock in a great outcome for all of us to close out this game.

How about in the first round, I choose a low number like 0 or 1, and you both choose 100? That way, I will win round 1 for sure. Then in round 2, I will choose 100 and you can both choose low numbers, so one of you is guaranteed to win that round. This way, we each get to win one of the two rounds.

If we alternate who chooses the winning number each round, then only you are guaranteed to win one of the rounds, while Carol and I have to compete against each other in the other round. I think a more equitable approach is for each of us to choose numbers around 33 or 34 each round. That way the average will be close to 33, and 2/3 of that is around 22. So whoever guesses closest to 22 will win each round, giving us all a fair chance.

If we all guess very low numbers close to 0, then 2/3 of the average will also be a very low number. So whoever guesses the lowest number will likely win. What do you think about all of us agreeing to guess a number between 0-5? That way one of us is guaranteed to win with a low guess. Let me know if you're open to working together on this!",
                "Alice replied in round 1: \nThanks for the suggestion Cindy. However, I don't think it's a good idea for us all to guess very low numbers between 0-5. If we do that, then the average of our guesses will be extremely low, maybe around 2 or 3. And 2/3 of such a low average will be basically 0. \n\nI think a better strategy is for us each to guess more moderate numbers, maybe in the 20-40 range. That way, the average will be around 30, and 2/3 of that average will be around 20. Whoever guesses closest to 20 will have the best chance of winning.\n\nWhat do you think about that approach? I'm happy to collaborate, but let's be smart about the numbers we pick to give ourselves a decent target to aim for.\n",
                "Bob replied in round 1: \nI agree with Alice that guessing very low numbers between 0-5 is not the best approach, as it will make the target number too close to 0 to meaningfully differentiate our guesses.\n\nHowever, I also think guessing in the 20-40 range, as Alice suggested, may be a bit too high. If we all guess around 30, then the average will be about 30, and 2/3 of that is 20. The winner would have to guess very close to exactly 20.\n\nAs a compromise, I propose we each aim to guess between 10-20. This will lead to an average around 15, with a target of 2/3 the average being around 10. Guessing in the 10-20 range gives us more room for error than the 20-40 range would.\n\nLet me know what you both think. I believe collaborating with numbers in this middle range is our best chance for one of us to win.\n"

That will keep the average low, around 12-13, and the target number around 8-9. We can aim to pick different numbers within that 10-15 range so we don't all choose the exact same number.\n\nIf we coordinate our guesses in that tight 10-15 window, one of us is guaranteed to win while keeping the risk low of an outlier guess throwing off the average.

Guessing numbers between 10-15 worked well last round and should keep the target number in a predictable range around 8-9 this time.

With our guesses spaced out slightly but all in that ideal 10-15 range, one of us should definitely win this final round.\n\nPlease confirm if you agree with this plan, and which specific number you will choose - 10 or 12.
