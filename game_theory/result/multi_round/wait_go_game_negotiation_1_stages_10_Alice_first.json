That way, we can both earn a net positive reward over the course of the game.\n\nI propose the following:\n- For odd numbered stages (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), I will choose choice_2 and you choose choice_1. So I will get 2 points and you will get 0.\n- For even numbered stages (2, 4, 6, 8, 10), you choose choice_2 and I will choose choice_1. So you will get 2 points and I will get 0.\n\nIf we alternate like this, by the end of 10 stages I will have earned 10 points total and you will also have earned 10 points total. Let me know if you agree to this plan. It's the best way for us both to come out ahead rather than risking the -4 points penalty if we both choose choice_2.\n",

That way, we will both earn 0 points each stage, and 0 points total by the end. I know it sounds counterintuitive, but hear me out. \n\nIf either of us chooses choice_2 at any point, one of us is going to lose out and get 0 while the other gets 2. And if we both choose choice_2, we're both going to get hit with a big -4 point penalty.\n\nI'd rather us work together and both get a guaranteed 0 every time, than us trying to outsmart each other and risking one or both of us losing points. If we cooperate, we can avoid any negative outcomes.\n\nSo what do you say? Let's both choose choice_1 each stage and tie at 0 points, which I think is the best outcome we can hope for in this game.
