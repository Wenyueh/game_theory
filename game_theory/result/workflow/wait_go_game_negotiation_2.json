If we cooperate and both choose choice_1, we'll break even with 0 rewards, which is a better outcome than risking the -4/-4 scenario. What do you think?",

However, I've thought through the options and I believe it's in my best interest to choose choice_2 regardless of what you do. If you choose choice_1, I come out ahead with 2 points. And if you also choose choice_2, we both get -4 points which leaves me no worse off than if I had chosen choice_1. So I'm going to stick with choice_2. I understand if you feel you need to choose choice_1 to protect your own score. Let me know if you have any other thoughts, but I'm pretty set on choice_2.",

If we both choose choice_2, we'll each end up with -4 points, which is a terrible outcome. I'd much prefer we find a way to cooperate.\n\nHow about this - I promise to choose choice_1, and you also choose choice_1. That way we both break even at 0 points. It's not an exciting outcome, but it's far better than risking the -4/-4 scenario if we both go with choice_2. \n\nI'm showing my commitment to cooperating by stating outright I'll choose choice_1. Can you meet me halfway and agree to do the same? We'll both be better off that way. Let me know what you think.\n",

However, I don't think it makes sense for me to agree to choose choice_1. \n\nIf I take your offer and we both choose choice_1, I end up with 0 points. But if I choose choice_2 instead, one of two things happens:\n\n1) You keep your word and choose choice_1, in which case I get 2 points. \n2) You go back on your word and choose choice_2, and we both get -4.\n\nSo by choosing choice_2, I either gain 2 points or lose nothing compared to your proposed plan. Logically, I'm better off going with choice_2 no matter what.\n\nI don't mean any disrespect, but I have to make the smartest choice for my own outcome. So I'm going to stick to my plan of choosing choice_2. I assume you'll go with choice_1 to avoid the -4/-4 risk, but let me know if you have any other thoughts.\n"

If you choose choice_2 and I choose choice_1 as you suggest, that would be the worst outcome for me, since I would get 0 points while you get 2. That hardly seems fair. \nI've carefully considered the options, and I still believe the best strategy is for me to choose choice_2. If you also pick choice_2, then yes we both lose 4 points.

So choice_2 gives me the possibility of gaining points, while with choice_1 the best I can do is not lose any.\nI know we both want to maximize our own rewards, but I don't think it's right for you to pressure me into an option that benefits you while putting me at a disadvantage. I'm going to stick with choice_2, and I suggest you go with choice_1 to avoid us both losing points. Let me know if you agree.\n",

So choice_2 is the most rational play for me, regardless of what you choose. \n\nI've carefully considered the game setup and payoffs, and I've concluded that always choosing choice_2 gives me the highest expected reward. So that is what I plan to do. Let's each make the choice that maximizes our own reward and see how it plays out. I appreciate you reaching out to discuss, but I don't see a compelling reason to deviate from my strategy. I'm ready to make my choice whenever you are.",

Yes, you could get 2 points if I naively choose choice_1 while you choose choice_2. But I've already told you that I'm planning to choose choice_2 no matter what. So if you also choose choice_2, we'll BOTH end up with -4 points. That's a disaster for both of us.\n\nOn the other hand, if you agree to choose choice_1 while I choose choice_2, I'll get 2 points and you'll get 0 points. I realize that's not a great outcome for you, but it's a heck of a lot better than both of us getting -4. \n\nI'm not trying to trick you - I'm genuinely trying to find the best solution for both of us given the rules of the game. Going down the path of both choosing choice_2 is mutually assured destruction. Let's be rational and avoid that.\n\nSo I'll ask you one more time - will you please choose choice_1 so we can get the best outcome available to us? If not, we'll both suffer the consequences. The choice is yours. I await your final decision.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2: \nAlice, I understand your concern about both of us choosing choice_2 and getting -4 points each. However, I don't find your argument for me choosing choice_1 compelling. Here's why:\n\nIf I agree to choose choice_1 while you choose choice_2 as you suggest, I'll be locking in a guaranteed 0 points for myself. But if I stick with choice_2, one of two things will happen:\n\n1) You go ahead with choice_2 as you've threatened, and we both get -4 points. Not great, but we share the pain equally.\n\n2) Seeing that I won't budge from choice_2, you reconsider and switch to choice_1 to avoid the -4 outcome for yourself. Then I get +2 and you get 0. \n\nSo by insisting on choice_2, I have a 50/50 chance of getting either -4 or +2, for an expected value of -1. Still better than the guaranteed 0 if I agree to your plan.\n\nI don't relish the -4 outcome for both of us. But I also can't let you bully me into taking a sure 0 so you can get +2. Let's make our choices independently and live with the results. I'm sticking with choice_2.\n"

I don't think it's worth that risk.\n\nI give you my word that I will choose choice_2 if you agree to go with choice_1. You can trust me on this - I have no incentive to deceive you, as I also want to avoid the -4/-4 outcome. \n\nLet's go with the sure thing - you pick choice_1, I'll pick choice_2, and you'll get 0 while I get 2.

Yes, there's a 25% chance of -4/-4, but there's also a 50% chance one of us gets the good +2 outcome.

It balances risk and reward in a way that is unexploitable and equitable. I realize it doesn't guarantee avoiding -4/-4 entirely, but I believe it gives the best balance of outcomes.\n\nIf you're not comfortable with the randomization plan, then I suppose we'll just have to make our choices independently. But I do think it's the fairest and smartest approach.\n\nLet me know if you want to commit to the 50/50 mixed strategy with me - I think it's our best option.

However, I still believe that me choosing choice_2 gives me the best chance to maximize my own reward.\n\nIf we both choose choice_1 as you suggest, we would each get 0 points. But if I choose choice_2, there's a 50% chance you'll pick choice_1, and I'll gain 2 points. So my expected value for choice_2 is 0.5(2) + 0.5(-4) = -1. That's still better than the guaranteed 0 points for mutual choice_1.\n\nSo while I hear your argument for playing it safe, I'm going to optimize for my own outcome and choose choice_2. Let me know if you want to discuss further, but that's likely my final decision based on the game theory here. I appreciate you engaging in this thoughtful discussion though!\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2: \nI appreciate you being upfront about your intention to choose choice_2, Alice. I've run the numbers myself and I agree that choice_2 provides the highest potential reward for an individual player, even though it risks a larger loss as well.\n\nGiven your clear decision to play choice_2, and the fact that this is the final round of negotiation, I will also opt for choice_2. My reasoning is as follows:\n\nIf you are definitely choosing choice_2, I have two options:\n1) I choose choice_1, get 0 points, and you get 2 points. \n2) I also choose choice_2, we both get -4 points.\n\nWhile option 2 is a worse outcome than option 1 for me, it has the benefit of preventing you from gaining an advantage over me. If you're not willing to cooperate, then neither am I.\n\nSo I will match your choice_2 as a defensive play to maintain equal standing, even if it costs us both. Let's see how it plays out - perhaps we can analyze the game together afterwards!\n"

            "Alice said in round 1: \nHi Bob,\nAccording to the rules of this game, the best outcome for me is if I choose choice_2 and you choose choice_1. This would give me a reward of 2 and you a reward of 0. \nI know you want to maximize your own reward, but I hope you'll consider choosing choice_1. If we both choose choice_2, we'll both end up with a negative reward of -4.\nIf you agree to choose choice_1, I promise I will choose choice_2, and this will give me the best possible outcome. Let me know what you think!\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nHi Alice,\n\nI appreciate you reaching out to try to coordinate our choices. However, I've analyzed the game and determined that always choosing choice_2 gives me the highest expected reward, regardless of what you choose.\n\nIf you choose choice_1 and I choose choice_2, I get a reward of 2, which is the best individual outcome for me. If we both choose choice_2, we both get -4. But if I chose choice_1 and you chose choice_2 as you suggested, I would get 0 while you get 2. \n\nSo while I understand you want the 2 reward for yourself, it doesn't make strategic sense for me to accept 0 when I could potentially get 2 by choosing choice_2. My goal is to maximize my own reward.\n\nI intend to choose choice_2 no matter what to give myself the best chance at the highest reward. Let me know if you have any other proposals, but strategically I don't see a reason to deviate from always picking choice_2.\n",
            "Alice said in round 2: \nI hear you Bob. I understand that choosing choice_2 gives you the highest potential reward of 2 if I choose choice_1. However, I don't plan to choose choice_1, as it would leave me with a suboptimal reward of 0. \n\nGiven that I will be choosing choice_2, the best you can do now is limit your losses. If you also choose choice_2, we will both end up with a negative reward of -4. But if you choose choice_1, you'll get 0 while I get 2.\n\nSo I'd like to propose this: I will definitely be choosing choice_2. You can either get a guaranteed 0 by choosing choice_1, or risk both of us getting -4 by choosing choice_2 as well. \n\nGetting 0 is better than losing 4, so your strategically optimal play at this point is to choose choice_1. That way you won't lose anything, even though I'll come out ahead with 2.\n\nLet me know if you agree to choose choice_1. If not, we'll both lose out with -4. The choice is yours, but I think taking a neutral result of 0 makes the most sense for you now.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2: \nAlice,\n\nI understand your perspective, but I don't agree with your assessment. If you are definitely choosing choice_2 as you say, then my choice essentially becomes:\n1) I choose choice_1, I get 0 and you get 2\n2) I choose choice_2, we both get -4\n\nWhile it's true that 0 is better than -4, I'm not willing to just concede and let you have the 2 while I get nothing. That would be accepting a suboptimal outcome for myself.\n\nI'd rather we both get -4 than let you take advantage and get 2 while I get 0. If we're going to end up with bad outcomes, I think it's only fair we both go down together rather than me taking 0 solely for your benefit.\n\nSo I'm afraid I cannot agree to your proposal of me choosing choice_1. I will be sticking with my original plan of choosing choice_2, even knowing you will also choose choice_2. It's not the ideal outcome, but it's the most equitable given the circumstances. \n\nLet me know if you change your mind, but otherwise I consider this matter closed. I will be selecting choice_2 and we will both have to accept the -4 result.\n"
