            "Bob replied in round 2 before the first action:\n\nAlice, while I understand you wanting a win-win outcome, I simply cannot agree to a strategy that does not maximize my own potential reward. You chose to start this negotiation by proposing a plan, but that doesn't obligate me to agree to it.\n\nThe fact remains that if you choose choice_2, and I follow with choice_1, I will obtain the highest possible reward of 5. Your assertion that you will be \"stuck with only 4 points\" feels like an emotional plea rather than sound game theory reasoning.\n\nI am committed to playing this game in my own best interest. You are free to make whatever initial choice you think is best for you. But I will be pursuing the strategy that gets me to 5 points, even if it leaves you with a suboptimal result. The game rules allow this, so I see no reason to settle for less than my maximum. \n\nIf you have nothing else to add, let's proceed with playing out our actions in the game. I'm ready to make my choice whenever you finalize yours.\n",

            "Alice said in round 1 before the third action:\nBob, I understand you want to maximize your own reward, but choosing choice_2 at this point does not guarantee that. If you choose choice_2 now, the best I can do for myself is also pick choice_2, which would only give us both 2 points. That's worse than the 5 points we each got from both choosing choice_1 initially.\n\nI urge you to reconsider your choice_2 and switch to choice_1 instead. That way, the game ends now with us locked in at 5 points each, the maximum possible. Sticking with choice_2 opens up the possibility of a much worse outcome for both of us. Let's solidify the win-win scenario while we can.\n\nPlease let me know if you will change your choice to 1 as I think that is best for both of us at this point in the game. I hope you see the logic in securing our mutually beneficial position.",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the third action:\n\nAlice, while I understand your perspective, I stand by my choice of choice_2 at this point in the game. Here's my reasoning:\n\nIf I switch to choice_1 now as you suggest, yes we would both be locked in at 5 points each. However, you are failing to account for the fact that you still have another decision to make after my choice.\n\nIf I choose choice_2, you can then choose between choice_1 (giving you 2 points and me 2 points) or choice_2 (giving you 3 points and me 4 points). Clearly, choice_2 is the better option for you if I stick with choice_2 now.\n\nSo the most likely outcome at this point is that I choose choice_2, then you also choose choice_2, resulting in a 3 point reward for you and a 4 point reward for me. That's better for both of us than the 2 points each we would get if you chose choice_1 after my choice_2.\n\nI aim to maximize my own reward, and 4 points is better than the 2 I would get if you responded to my choice_2 with your choice_1. So I believe my best option is to maintain my selection of choice_2.\n\nThe choice is yours, but I hope you see the logic in selecting choice_2 yourself if I stick with choice_2 here, as it improves both of our rewards compared to you choosing choice_1. Let me know what you decide.\n",
            "Alice said in round 2 before the third action:\n\nYou make a fair point, Bob. If you stick with choice_2 and I also choose choice_2 after that, I would get 3 points and you would get 4 points, which is better for both of us than if I chose choice_1 and we both only got 2 points. \n\nEven though 3 points for me and 4 points for you isn't a fully equal distribution, it's still an improvement over the 2 points each we would get otherwise at this stage. And it's the best achievable outcome remaining in the game.\n\nSo I agree with your logic. If you're committed to choice_2, it makes the most sense for me to also choose choice_2 when it's my turn. That maximizes both of our rewards with the options still available to us.\n\nLet's lock that in then - you'll stick with choice_2 and I'll follow up with choice_2 as well to give us the 3-4 point distribution. Thanks for talking it through with me and helping us reach the optimal solution at this point in the game. Shall we proceed with those choices?\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2 before the third action:\n\nAlice, I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this with me and see the logic in the strategy I proposed. You're absolutely right that at this point, the best remaining outcome is for me to stick with choice_2 and for you to also choose choice_2 on your turn. That will result in you getting 3 points and me getting 4 points.\n\nAs you said, while it's not a fully equal split, it maximizes both of our rewards with the options still on the table. It's a definite improvement over the 2 points each we would be stuck with if you chose choice_1 in response to my choice_2.\n\nSo I'm glad we're in agreement on this - I will lock in choice_2 and then you can follow up with choice_2 as well. That will give us the best achievable score distribution at this stage of 3 points for you and 4 points for me.\n\nThanks for engaging in this constructive negotiation to help us arrive at the optimal strategy to benefit both of us as much as possible moving forward. I'm now ready to proceed with my choice_2 whenever you are ready to finalize yours.\n"
