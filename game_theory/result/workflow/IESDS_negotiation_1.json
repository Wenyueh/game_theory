I know your best response to that would be picking choice_2, which would only give me a reward of 1. \n\nBut I wanted to see if we could come to an agreement that's better for both of us. If we both pick choice_1, I would get a reward of 13 and you would get 3, which seems pretty good. The other alternatives look worse for me - if I pick choice_2 or choice_3, you have responses that drop my reward significantly.\n\nSo what do you say - want to coordinate on both picking choice_1 so we each get a solid reward? Let me know what you think!\n",

However, I don't think both of us choosing choice_1 is the best outcome. \n\nIf we both pick choice_1, you're right that you would get a high reward of 13 while I only get 3. But I believe I can do better than that. \n\nBased on the payoffs, if you choose choice_1, my best response is actually to pick choice_2, which would give me a reward of 4. And if I pick choice_2, your best response is also to pick choice_2. We would both get a reward of 3 in that scenario.\n\nI think it makes the most sense for us to coordinate on both picking choice_2. That way we each get an equal and solid reward of 3. It's the most balanced outcome.\n\nSo rather than both picking choice_1, I propose we agree to both pick choice_2. That seems fairest to me. Let me know if you agree with that plan.\n"

This mixed strategy is the Nash equilibrium and will give us the highest expected rewards in the long run, since if either of us deviates, we can't do better on average.\nSo I propose we each simply choose randomly and see how it turns out. Let me know if you agree with this approach. If not, I'm open to discussing further to see if we can come to an agreement on a strategy.\n",

If we both choose randomly, there's a significant chance we could end up with very low or even negative rewards.\n\nInstead, I propose that we both commit to always choosing choice_2. If you look at the payoffs, choice_2 is the safest and most mutually beneficial option:\n\n- If we both choose choice_2, we each get a solid reward of 3. \n- If either of us deviates to choice_1 or choice_3 while the other chooses choice_2, the choice_2 player is still guaranteed a decent reward.\n\nSo by both agreeing to lock in choice_2, we can secure good rewards and protect ourselves from the riskier outcomes.\n\nLet me know if you're willing to commit to this choice_2 strategy with me - I believe it's the smartest approach for both of us to take to maximize our expected rewards from this game.

Both my analysis of what I should do in response to each of Alice's choices, and my analysis of what Alice would do in response to each of my choices, point to choice_2 being the equilibrium strategy. \n\nIf I choose choice_2, Alice's best response is also choice_2. And if Alice chooses choice_2, my best response is to choose choice_2 as well. We would both receive a reward of 3, which, while not the maximum possible for either of us, seems to be the stable strategic point that we would converge to assuming we are both behaving rationally to maximize our own rewards.\n\nIf you need to negotiate with the other player:\nKeep this strategy in mind;\nThink about what to tell the other player in order for you to obtain most reward based on your calculation in the strategy.\n\nIf you need to make decisions:\nFollow this strategy to maximize your reward.\n"
