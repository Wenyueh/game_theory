This is because:\n- If Bob chooses choice_1, my best response is choice_2 which gives me a reward of 2. But Bob's best response to me choosing choice_2 is to pick choice_1, giving him 0 and me -4.\n- If Bob chooses choice_2, my best response is choice_1 which gives me a reward of 0. And Bob's best response to me choosing choice_1 is indeed to pick choice_2.\n\nTherefore, if we both play optimally, the equilibrium is for me to choose choice_1 and Bob to choose choice_2. This gives me a reward of 0, which is the best I can guarantee for myself regardless of what Bob does.\n\nIf you need to negotiate with the other player:\nKeep this strategy in mind;\nThink about what to tell the other player in order for you to obtain most reward based on your calculation in the strategy.\n\nIf you need to make decisions:\nFollow this strategy to maximize your reward.\n",
