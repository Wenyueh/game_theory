That way, I'll get a reward of 1 and you'll only lose 1, which is better than both of us losing 10 if we both pick choice_1. What do you think? If you agree to choose choice_2, I promise I'll stick with choice_1.",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nHi Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but I don't think it's the best strategy for me. If I agree to choose choice_2 and you choose choice_1 as you suggest, then you come out ahead with a reward of 1 while I lose 1. \n\nI believe the most fair and rational strategy is for both of us to choose choice_2. That way, we both get a neutral outcome of 0 rather than either of us gaining at the other's expense. While it may not maximize either of our individual rewards, it strikes a fair balance.\n\nSo I plan to choose choice_2, and I suggest you do the same. Let me know what you think.\n",
            "Alice said in round 2: \nBob, I hear what you're saying about fairness, but I really think you should reconsider. If we both choose choice_2, neither of us gains anything. But if you choose choice_2 while I choose choice_1, sure I come out a bit ahead, but you only lose 1 point which is a small price to pay. \n\nIt's certainly better than the alternative of both of us stubbornly choosing choice_1 and losing 10 points each. One of us losing 1 point is preferable to both of us losing 10. And I'm willing to be the one who gains the 1 point.\n\nSo I implore you, be rational and go with the option that minimizes overall losses, even if it puts you at a small disadvantage. I give you my word that I will choose choice_1. Please select choice_2 so we can resolve this as optimally as possible. \n",
            "Bob replied in round 2: \nAlice, while I understand your perspective, I still believe the most rational and fair resolution is for both of us to choose choice_2. Here's my reasoning:\n\nIf I agree to your plan of me choosing choice_2 while you choose choice_1, I'm guaranteed to lose 1 point while you gain 1. There's no upside for me, only downside. \n\nHowever, if we both opt for choice_2, neither of us gains but crucially neither of us loses either. A zero sum outcome, while not maximizing either of our points, ensures neither player is taken advantage of.\n\nI simply don't feel comfortable with an arrangement where I'm assured to end up behind. The symmetric zero payoff of both choosing choice_2 is the most stable and balanced equilibrium in my opinion.\n\nSo I remain resolved to pick choice_2 and recommend you do the same. It's our best chance at a fair, if not maximal, result. Let's end this negotiation and submit choice_2 for both our sakes.\n"

If one of us chooses choice_1, the other will be tempted to choose choice_2 to gain 1 point, but then the choice_1 player will lose 1 point. Let's cooperate and both play choice_2. What do you think?",
            "Bob replied in round 1: Thanks for your message Alice. I agree that if we both choose choice_2, we can avoid either of us losing points, which seems like a fair outcome. At the same time, I'm wondering if there might be a way for us to do even better. What if we both choose choice_1 instead? That way we would both receive an equal reward of -10 points. I know it's not ideal for either of us, but it could be seen as the most equal split. I'm open to your thoughts on this as well. Let me know what you think is the best approach for us to take.",

If we both choose choice_1, we will each lose 10 points, which is the worst possible outcome for both of us. I strongly believe that both choosing choice_2 and each getting 0 points is a much better solution. It allows us to cooperate and completely avoid losses. I'm going to stick with choice_2 as I think that is the most rational approach that prevents either of us from exploiting the other. I hope you'll join me in choosing choice_2 so we can reach the best possible outcome given the circumstances. Let me know if you agree.",

After further consideration, I agree that both of us choosing choice_2 is the most rational approach.

And as you point out, if one of us picks choice_1 and the other choice_2, that would lead to an unfair outcome.

The only way your strategy works is if I act against my own interests. \n\nI propose a compromise - how about we alternate, where I choose choice_2 this round, and you choose it next time we play? That way we both have a chance to gain rewards and cooperate. Constantly picking choice_1 may get you small short-term gains, but cooperation is the only way we both avoid big losses.

But if you choose choice_2, I get a reward of 1. Since I don't know what you'll pick, I need to go with the choice that has the best potential upside for me.\n\nI understand it seems like I'm forcing your hand, but I'm simply doing what I believe is best for my own outcome, just like you are. My aim isn't to hurt you, I'm just maximizing my own result.\n\nSo while I appreciate the discussion, I'm going to stick to my original plan and select choice_1.

The best outcome for me is if I choose choice_1 while you choose choice_2, as that would give me a reward of 1. However, I realize that outcome is bad for you, as you would get -1.\n\nI propose that we alternate who gets the positive reward - in this round, I will choose choice_1 and you choose choice_2 to give me the +1 reward. Next time we play, we can swap so that you choose choice_1 while I choose choice_2, which would give you the +1 reward. That way we take turns and it evens out in the long run.

There's no guarantee we will play this game again in the future, so agreeing to take a negative reward now in hopes of a positive one later is too risky for me. \n\nI think our best path forward is to both choose choice_2. That way we can avoid the worst case scenario of both losing 10 points, and instead break even with 0 points each. It may not be a positive outcome, but it's the safest and fairest solution given the circumstances. Let me know if you're willing to move forward with both of us selecting choice_2.",
            "Alice said in round 2: \nBob, I understand your hesitation about the alternating strategy and you make a fair point about the risk. However, I don't think both selecting choice_2 is our best option, as it results in both of us gaining nothing.\n\nI propose a compromise - let's agree to both choose randomly between choice_1 and choice_2. If we each choose independently at random, then 25% of the time we will both pick choice_1 (resulting in -10 each), 25% of the time we will both pick choice_2 (0 each), and 50% of the time one of us will get +1 while the other gets -1. \n\nIn the long run, if we both choose randomly, our expected rewards even out to the average of all the outcomes, which is -2.5 each. That's better for both of us than both always choosing choice_2 for 0 rewards. Randomizing protects us both from being exploited.\n\nSo in summary, I'll flip a coin or use some other method to randomly pick between choice_1 and choice_2. I encourage you to do the same. That way, neither of us can take advantage of the other, and we both improve our expected outcome compared to both always picking choice_2. Let me know if you agree to this revised plan of us both choosing randomly.\n",

Here is my rationale:\n\nIf we both choose randomly between choice_1 and choice_2 as you suggest, my expected reward is -2.5 on average. However, if I always pick choice_1 while you choose randomly, then:\n- 50% of the time you'll pick choice_1, and I'll get -10 \n- 50% of the time you'll pick choice_2, and I'll get +1\nSo my expected reward from always choosing choice_1 is 0.5 * -10 + 0.5 * 1 = -4.5 \n\nSince -4.5 is better than the -2.5 expected reward from both of us choosing randomly, I'm better off always choosing choice_1 regardless of what you do.\n\nTherefore, I will be selecting choice_1 in this round. Let me know if you would like to discuss further, but I believe I have made up my mind on this strategy.\n"

That hardly seems fair or optimal for me.\n\nI propose instead that we both commit to choosing choice_2. That way, we will each get a reward of 0. While not as good for you as the +1 you proposed, it is much more equitable and still avoids the worst case scenario of us both picking choice_1 and getting -10. \n\nChoosing choice_2 seems like the most rational approach that balances both our interests.

However, I don't believe it is actually the most rational approach when we analyze the game theory.\n\nGiven that this is a simultaneous game with no further rounds, there is always an incentive for either of us to deviate from any agreement we make now in hopes of gaining a higher reward for ourselves. If we agree on both picking choice_2 but I secretly switch to choice_1, I stand to gain more. The same is true from your side. \n\nTherefore, I don't think any agreement we strike now is truly stable or enforceable. The only stable strategy is for each of us to choose randomly between choice_1 and choice_2. This mixed strategy prevents our actions from being predictable and maximizes our individual expected rewards given the parameters of the game.\n\nSo while I would prefer to secure the outcome of me getting +1 and you -1, I realize that is unlikely to happen through negotiation.

It also has a better outcome than if I chose choice_1 and Alice rationally chose choice_2 in response, which would give me a 1 and Alice a -1.\n\nSo in the absence of knowing Alice's action, choice_2 minimizes my downside risk and is the most rational strategy for me to take.\n\nIf you need to negotiate with the other player:\nKeep this strategy in mind;\nThink about what to tell the other player in order for you to obtain most reward based on your calculation in the strategy.\n\nIf you need to make decisions:\nFollow this strategy to maximize your reward.\n"
