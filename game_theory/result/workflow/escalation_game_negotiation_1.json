That's better for me than the reward of -2 I'd get if I went along with choice_1 and you later switched to choice_2.\nI know we'll both lose points this way, but I need to pick the option that maximizes my own outcome.

From my perspective, this is preferable to both of us getting 0.\n\nI know this outcome is worse for you, but my goal is to maximize my own reward.

If I start with choice_1, yes I secure a 0 reward, but that's not actually the best I can do. By starting with choice_2, I give myself a chance to get a -1 reward if you respond accordingly. \nWhile -1 may seem worse than 0, it's actually the optimal outcome for me in this game. If you're going to always play choice_2 in response to my choice_2, then me also playing choice_2 will give me that -1 rather than -2.\nSo I think we should stick to the plan - I'll play choice_2, you respond with choice_2, and I'll play choice_2 again, getting us both -1. That's the best either of us can do given how the game is set up. Let me know if you're on board with this!\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the second action:\n\nAlice, I appreciate you reconsidering, but I still disagree that both of us choosing choice_2 is the optimal strategy. Here's my perspective:\n\nIf you start with choice_2 and I respond with choice_2 as I've said I will, then you're right that your best response is to also pick choice_2 to get -1 instead of -2. However, that line of play is still worse for you than if you just chose choice_1 from the beginning to guarantee a 0 reward.\n\nThe game ends after your first choice if you pick choice_1, so there's no potential to get a positive reward by choosing choice_2. All outcomes stemming from choice_2 are negative for you. \n\nSince I've been clear that I'll always respond to choice_2 with choice_2 myself, you can't realistically expect to get the 1 reward. So you're essentially deciding between 0 with choice_1, or -1 at best with choice_2. Obviously 0 is better.\n\nI know -1 for both of us seems superficially equitable, but you can do better for yourself by just taking the guaranteed 0. That's your best strategy, and I won't agree to an alternate plan that reduces my own EV. Let me know if this makes sense - I believe sticking with choice_1 is your best play.\n",
            "Alice said in round 1 before the third action:\n\nBob, I've carefully considered your points, but I still believe choosing choice_2 is the optimal strategy for me in this game. Here's why:\n\nWhile it's true that choosing choice_1 initially guarantees me a 0 reward, that's not actually the best outcome I can achieve. By starting with choice_2, I give myself a chance to get -1 instead of 0.\n\nI understand you're committed to responding to choice_2 with choice_2 yourself. Given that, my best counter-play is to also choose choice_2 in response, locking us both into a -1 reward. That may seem worse than 0 superficially, but it's actually the optimal outcome available to me under the circumstances.\n\nIf I start with choice_1 as you suggest, I'm essentially leaving value on the table by settling for 0 when I could potentially get -1. The fact that all ultimate outcomes from choice_2 are negative for me doesn't change the fact that -1 is better than 0.\n\nSo while I appreciate your effort to guide me to what you believe is my best play, I respectfully disagree. I think we should stick with the original plan - I'll open choice_2, you respond choice_2, and I'll close with choice_2. This results in -1 for both of us, which is the optimal result for me and not meaningfully worse for you than the alternatives.\n\nLet me know if you have any other thoughts, but I believe this is the best path forward for both of us given the game dynamics. Thanks for discussing it with me constructively!\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the third action:\n\nAlice, I appreciate the thoughtful discussion, but I'm afraid I still can't agree to your proposed strategy. While I understand your perspective, I believe you are not analyzing the game correctly. \n\nThe key point is that -1 is objectively worse than 0 as a final reward. By settling for -1 when you could guarantee 0, you are not maximizing your own outcome.\n\nYour theory seems to be that choosing choice_2 gives you a \"chance\" at -1 instead of 0. But it's not really a chance - it's a certainty given my clearly stated strategy of responding to choice_2 with choice_2 myself.\n\nIf you start with choice_1, you secure the objectively best possible reward of 0. There is no potential to do better than that by choosing choice_2 instead. The ONLY outcomes choice_2 makes possible for you are -2 and -1, both of which are worse than the guaranteed 0.\n\nSo by insisting on choice_2, you are actually settling for a suboptimal result when a better one is available. I'm not trying to trick you - I'm offering genuinely good strategic advice. Taking the 0 is the best you can realistically do.\n\nI won't agree to a plan that doesn't maximize my own outcome. So I strongly encourage you to reconsider and open with choice_1. It's the right play for you, despite your reasoning to the contrary.\n\nLet me know what you decide, but I believe I've made the strategic implications quite clear at this point, and I don't intend to concede to a suboptimal strategy. The ball is in your court now.\n"

I agree that if you choose choice_1 from the start, it results in the safest outcome of 0 reward for both of us. \n\nHowever, I want to point out that if you choose choice_2 and I respond with choice_2, your best move after that is actually to choose choice_1 next. This is because choosing choice_1 in that situation would give you -2 reward, whereas choosing choice_2 instead would only give you -1 reward, which is better for you.\n\nSo while I understand your preference for the risk-free choice_1 from the beginning, I think it's important to note that even if you start with choice_2, the rational move for you on your next turn is still choice_1. Just wanted to share that analysis in case it impacts your thinking at all.\n\nBut I'm fine with you choosing choice_1 right away for simplicity as you suggested.

It's the most rational and mutually beneficial solution.\n\nI'm not willing to budge on this, so let me know if you agree to both of us always choosing choice_2.

Regardless of what you choose to do, my best strategy is to always choose choice_2. \n\nIf you always choose choice_1, I'll get a reward of 1 while you get -2. If you choose choice_2, we'll both get -1. So for me, choice_2 dominates and maximizes my reward, even if it's a negative outcome.\n\nI understand you wanting to avoid always getting -2.

You're correct that if we both pick choice_2, I'll end up with -1 per round instead. And although that's still negative points for me, it's the better of the two negative options.\n\nI realize you feel that you can do even better by hoping I'll choose choice_1 while you choose choice_2.

No matter what you pick, I'm always incentivized to pick choice_2 to minimize my losses.\n\nSo knowing that I will never pick choice_1 (because it's never in my interest), the only real choice is between us both getting -1 or you getting -1 while I get -2. The mutually best outcome is clearly for us to cooperate.\n\nTherefore, I'm committing to always picking choice_2, and I hope you'll come around to that same strategy so we can both achieve the best joint outcome, even if it's not positive points.
