That way we can each guarantee getting a reward of 1, rather than risking getting 0 if one of us chooses choice_1 and the other chooses choice_2. Choosing choice_2 is the safest option for both of us. What do you think?",
            "Bob replied in round 1: I appreciate your perspective, Alice. However, I think it's in both of our best interests if I choose choice_2 and you choose choice_1. That way, I can maximize my reward at 5 points. I know you would receive 0 points in that scenario, but I need to do what's best for me. If you choose choice_2 and I choose choice_2, we only get 1 point each which isn't optimal for me. So I strongly encourage you to choose choice_1 while I choose choice_2. That's the best outcome from my perspective."

That way, I would get a reward of 5 and you would get 0, which maximizes my own reward. I know you'll be tempted to also choose choice_2 to guarantee yourself a reward of 1. But I wanted to be upfront that I'm planning to go with choice_2 no matter what. So you're better off going with choice_1 and at least getting 0 rather than both of us ending up with the minimum reward of 1. Let me know if you have any other thoughts, but that's my strong preference to maximize my own outcome in this game.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nHi Alice, I appreciate you sharing your perspective. However, I have to respectfully disagree that me choosing choice_1 while you choose choice_2 is the best outcome. If you look at it from my side, choosing choice_2 always gives me the highest possible reward, regardless of what you pick:\n- If you choose choice_1 and I choose choice_2, I get 5 (vs 3 if I chose choice_1)  \n- If you choose choice_2 and I choose choice_2, I get 1 (vs 0 if I chose choice_1)\n\nSo while I understand you want to maximize your own reward, choice_2 is unequivocally the best strategic choice for me. I'm not just trying to guarantee a minimum reward - I'm playing to get the maximum reward for myself.  \n\nGiven that we both seem set on choosing choice_2 to maximize our individual outcomes, it appears we will end up with a reward of 1 each. Let me know if you want to discuss further, but I don't see a compelling reason for me to change my choice here. I'll be proceeding with choice_2.\n"
