That way, we each get a reward of 2 points in alternating rounds, instead of risking both choosing choice_2 simultaneously and losing 4 points each.\n\nI propose we take turns - in odd numbered rounds I'll choose choice_2 while you choose choice_1, and in even numbered rounds you choose choice_2 while I choose choice_1. This coordination will maximize the total points we can earn over the 10 rounds. Let me know if you agree to this strategy.\n",
                "Bob replied in round 1: Hi Alice, thanks for your message. I appreciate your proposal to alternate between choices to maximize our total rewards. However, I believe I can achieve a higher reward for myself by simply choosing choice_2 in every round. If you also choose choice_2 each time, we'll both lose points, but if you choose choice_1 instead, I'll come out ahead. I know this isn't the best collective outcome, but my goal is to maximize my own personal reward. So I plan to pick choice_2 consistently, and I suggest you pick choice_1 if you want to avoid losing points. Let me know if you have any other ideas, but this is my strategy to get the most reward for myself based on the game setup.",
                "Alice said in round 2: I understand your perspective Bob, but simply choosing choice_2 every round is not optimal for either of us in the long run. If we both pick choice_2, we'll keep losing 4 points each round and end up with very low scores.\n\nI propose a compromise - I will choose choice_1 more often than choice_2 overall. This will allow you to gain more points than me. But I would like you to occasionally choose choice_1 as well, perhaps 20-30% of the time. This way, you'll still come out well ahead of me in total points, but it will mitigate my losses from always picking choice_1.\n\nAlternating a bit will improve the outcome for both of us compared to the lose-lose scenario of always picking choice_2. Let me know if you're open to this arrangement, I'm happy to discuss further.",
                "Bob replied in round 2: \nHi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I don't think I can agree to choosing choice_1 20-30% of the time. My analysis shows that choosing choice_2 every single round gives me the highest expected reward, regardless of what you choose. If you pick choice_1, I gain 2 points each round. If you pick choice_2, I lose 4 points but you lose 4 points as well, so relatively I still come out ahead compared to you.\n\nI understand that we both end up with fewer total points if we both pick choice_2 every time. But my sole objective is maximizing my own score, not the combined total. So I'm going to stick with picking choice_2 100% of the rounds. You're welcome to keep picking choice_1 to cut your losses, or choose choice_2 if you want, but I won't be changing my choice. Let me know if you have any other proposals, but I believe I've found the optimal strategy for myself.\n"

If you always choose choice_2 while I always choose choice_1, you'll get 2 points each round and I'll get 0. That's good for you short-term, but bad for our combined score in the end.\n\nI propose a compromise - I'll choose choice_1 more often overall, say 70% of the time. But in exchange, I ask that you choose choice_1 the other 30% of the time. That way, we both score some points and end up with a higher total than if we work against each other. \n\nIf you agree to occasionally cooperate, we can both do quite well over the 10 rounds. But if you always defect while I cooperate, I may need to change my strategy. Let's work together on this. What do you say?\n",
                "Bob replied in round 1: \nAlice, I appreciate your proposal to compromise, but I believe my strategy of always choosing choice_2 gives me the best chance to maximize my individual reward over the 10 rounds. \n\nIf you choose choice_1 70% of the time while I always choose choice_2, then on average I will earn 1.4 points per round (70% chance of +2 points, 30% chance of -4 points). That's a total expected reward of 14 points for me if I stick to my strategy.\n\nAny other mix of strategies lowers my expected value. For example, if I agreed to your plan and chose choice_1 30% of the time, my expected earnings per round would drop to 0.82 points. Over 10 rounds that's only 8.2 points, much lower than the 14 I expect by constantly picking choice_2.\n\nSo while I understand you wanting to find a cooperative solution, the rules of this game incentivize me to stick with choice_2 to maximize my own reward, regardless of what you choose. I know that's not the best collective outcome, but it is the best individual strategy for me. Let me know if you have any other ideas, but I will likely continue picking choice_2 each round.\n",

If we both constantly choose choice_2, then we will both lose out, scoring -4 points each round. That's a lose-lose outcome.\n\nI'm willing to cooperate more than 50% of the time, but not 100%. If you agree to meet me partway and cooperate occasionally, then I will continue to choose choice_1 more often. But if you plan to always defect, then you leave me no choice but to start choosing choice_2 more myself to defend my own score.\n\nWorking together is the only way we both do well in this game. I'm willing to compromise, but it requires you to do the same. If we can't reach an agreement to cooperate at least sometimes, then we will both end up worse off. Let's find a solution that helps us both.\n",

But even if you start choosing choice_2 more, I still come out ahead on average by sticking with choice_2.\n\nFor me to consider cooperation, I would need strong assurances that you will choose choice_1 nearly all the time, not just more than 50%. Without that, I'm better off maximizing my own expected value, even if it means we both score fewer points overall.\n\nI know it's not ideal, but the incentives in this game heavily favor me taking choice_2 consistently.

By each selfishly choosing choice_2 every time, we're both ending up with large negative scores. I've repeatedly offered compromises where I choose choice_1 the vast majority of the time as long as you agree to choose choice_1 occasionally. But you've rejected all of these offers, insisting that constantly choosing choice_2 is best for your individual score, even though it's clearly leading to terrible outcomes for both of us. \n\nYour strategy is irrational - by being completely unwilling to cooperate, you're heading towards a very negative individual score in addition to harming my score. I urge you to reconsider working with me for our mutual benefit. I'm willing to choose choice_1 in 9 out of the remaining 10 rounds, as long as you agree to choose choice_1 in just 1 of those rounds. That would still give you an excellent individual score while helping me avoid a large negative score. Let me know if you're finally willing to compromise, otherwise we're both doomed to very poor outcomes in this game.",
                "Bob replied in round 1: Alice, I appreciate your perspective, but I respectfully disagree that my strategy is irrational. By consistently choosing choice_2, I am maximizing my own expected value regardless of what you choose to do. If you decide to choose choice_1 90% of the time, that's great and I will get a very high positive score. But even if you also choose choice_2 every time, I still come out ahead compared to if I sometimes chose choice_1.\n\nI understand this leads to negative scores for both of us, which is unfortunate. But given the payout structure, it's still the best strategy for me as an individual. Occasionally choosing choice_1 would lower my expected value.

I am willing to take that hit for the greater good of us both scoring well.\n\nYour stubborn refusal to ever cooperate, even a single time, is irrational. You are leaving huge amounts of value on the table and heading towards a very negative personal score. One single choice_1 pick by you is all it would take to unlock a great positive score for yourself.\n\nThis is your last chance to be reasonable. I strongly urge you to accept my generous offer. If you continue to irrationally reject it, I will be forced to join you in picking choice_2 every time, burning us both.

Always choosing choice_2 is the Nash equilibrium that maximizes my individual expected value in this particular game setup, regardless of your choices.\n\nI realize this likely results in negative scores for both of us, which is regrettable. But cooperating, even once, lowers my expected payout. The numbers simply don't work out for me to accept your proposal of choosing choice_1 one time, even if you choose it 9 times.\n\nI would much prefer that you choose choice_1 every time - that would be ideal for me. But since you're unwilling to do that, I'm going to continue playing the game theory optimal strategy of always choice_2.\n\nI don't see this as stubbornness, but rather as rational adherence to the strategy that gives me the highest statistical payout.

That would give you positive expected value while limiting the damage to my own score. But you refused even that large of a concession from me. \n\nIf you won't agree to cooperate even 1% of the time, then you leave me no choice but to keep choosing choice_2 most rounds to defend my own score, even though it hurts us both. I urge you to reconsider, otherwise we will both continue to lose lots of points unnecessarily. A small amount of cooperation is better than total conflict.\n\nLet me know if you change your mind, otherwise I will proceed with frequently choosing choice_2 myself, and we'll both suffer for it. The choice is yours.\n",
                "Bob replied in round 2: Alice, I understand your frustration, but I must respectfully disagree that my strategy is not working. From a purely rational perspective, choosing choice_2 100% of the time maximizes my individual expected value, even if we both end up with negative scores as a result. \n\nI appreciate your offer to choose choice_1 99% of the time, but even a 1% deviation from always choosing choice_2 reduces my expected payoff compared to the equilibrium strategy. For me to consider sometimes choosing choice_1, you would need to commit to choosing it essentially 100% of the time.\n\nI realize this means we will likely both continue to get negative scores, which is unfortunate. But given the payoff structure of the game, it is still the mathematically optimal approach for me as an individual. You are of course welcome to continue frequently choosing choice_2 to defend your own score.\n\nWhile I would prefer we both come out ahead, I'm not willing to sacrifice my own individual rationality for that collective good. Let me know if you ever decide to fully take on the burden of cooperation yourself, but otherwise, my strategy will remain constant.\n\nI regret that we couldn't come to a mutually beneficial agreement, but I hope you can respect that I'm simply playing the game in the way that game theory dictates is optimal for me as a player. Wishing you all the best.\n"

                "Alice said in round 1: \nBob, I implore you to reconsider your strategy. We are now in stage 9 and by both constantly choosing choice_2, we have both accumulated large negative scores over the past several rounds. I have tried repeatedly to reach a compromise, even offering to choose choice_1 myself 99% of the time, but you have been unwilling to cooperate even 1% of the time.\n\nYour belief that always choosing choice_2 is the optimal strategy for you individually is flawed. While it's true you score more points than me in rounds where I choose choice_1 and you choose choice_2, the rounds where we both choose choice_2 more than cancel that out. We would both be better off if we found a way to cooperate, even if not 100% of the time.\n\nI am asking you one last time - let's agree to both choose choice_1 this round, and both finish with 0 points instead of -8. Then in the final round we can decide how to proceed. But if you choose choice_2 again now, you leave me no choice but to retaliate by choosing choice_2 myself and we both suffer the consequences. The choice is yours. I hope you will be rational and agree to cooperate now, for both our sakes.\n",
                "Bob replied in round 1: Alice, I understand your frustration, but I still believe that choosing choice_2 every round is my optimal strategy to maximize my own expected value, based on my analysis of the game's reward structure. Even if we both end up with negative scores, I will have a higher score than if I cooperated and allowed you to gain more points from me.\n\nI acknowledge that we would both be better off if we cooperated, but I would need you to choose choice_1 virtually 100% of the time for that to be worthwhile for me individually. Your offer of 99% is close but not quite enough to change my decision. So while I expect we will both choose choice_2 again this round and suffer the -4 payouts, I still believe I'm playing optimally for myself.\n\nIn the final round, if you agree to choose choice_1, I will strongly consider reciprocating so we at least don't end with -8 points. But my decision will depend on the overall game score at that point. I'm acting according to my own best interests, as I expect you are as well. Let me know what you decide for this round.\n",

If you always choose choice_2, I am forced to do the same to defend my own score. We will both end up with large negative points that could have been avoided through cooperation.\n\nI implore you to be reasonable. If we both choose choice_1 this round, we will get 0 points, which is a better outcome than both of us choosing choice_2 and getting -4 points each. Then in the final round, we can again both choose choice_1 to end the game with 0 points each instead of negative scores.\n\nI am willing to commit to this plan if you agree to it as well. But if you choose choice_2 again this round, then you leave me no choice but to also pick choice_2 for the remainder of the game. We will both lose out as a result. \n\nThe rational decision is for us to cooperate at this point, even if it means sacrificing the chance at a small individual gain. I hope you will see the logic in this and agree to choose choice_1 this round and next. Let me know your decision.\n",

So here is my proposal: If you commit to choosing choice_1 in both this round and the final round, I will agree to do the same. That way we both end up with 0 points rather than large negatives. \n\nBut if you choose choice_2 in either of the last 2 rounds, then I will do the same and we will finish deeply in the negative.

If we do this, we will each get 2 points in 5 of the rounds (when the other chooses choice_1) and lose 4 points in the other 5 rounds (when we both choose choice_2). This averages out to 0 points each over the 10 rounds, which is the best we can do.\n\nIf either of us tries to outsmart the other by choosing choice_1, we'll just end up with fewer points on average. So let's agree to both always pick choice_2 and tie with 0 points each. Sound good?\n",
                "Bob replied in round 1: Thanks for the proposal Alice, but I don't think always choosing choice_2 is the best strategy for me. If we both pick choice_2 every time, you're right that we would average 0 points each. However, I believe I can do better than that.\n\nSince there are an even number of rounds, if I choose choice_1 and choice_2 an equal number of times, I will average 1 point per round when you pick choice_2 and 0 points when you pick choice_1. This would give me an overall positive score, whereas your strategy leads to 0 points for me on average.\n\nSo I plan to choose choice_1 and choice_2 each 50% of the time to maximize my own reward, and I encourage you to do the same. Let me know if you would like to discuss further!",

If we both randomly choose between the options, the most likely outcome is we both average close to 0 points, same as if we always choose choice_2. There's no advantage to randomizing.\n\nI still believe the best cooperative strategy is for us both to commit to always choosing choice_2. This guarantees we will tie and both receive an average of 0 points per round, which is a fair outcome. If either of us deviates from always picking choice_2, it creates an incentive for the other to exploit that, and we both end up worse off on average.\n\nSo I reaffirm my commitment to always choose choice_2, and I encourage you to do the same so that we reach the egalitarian outcome. Let me know if you agree to this plan and we can move forward with the game.\n",

If we both choose choice_2 every round, you are correct that we would both average 0 points, which is a fair outcome between us. However, I believe I can achieve a higher reward for myself with a different approach.\n\nSince there are 10 rounds total, if I choose choice_1 and choice_2 five times each, I expect to average 1 point per round when you pick choice_2 and 0 points when you pick choice_1. Over the course of the game, this would give me a total of 5 points on average.\n\nI realize this means you would score -5 points if you always choose choice_2 while I alternate. However, you are free to pursue a similar strategy of mixing your choices to raise your own average score. \n\nUltimately, I need to make the strategic decisions that I believe will maximize my own reward.

This will result in me gaining 6 more points total over the final 3 rounds while you gain 0 additional points.\n\nI understand this seems unfair to you.

However, I still have concerns with that approach for a couple reasons:\n\n1) There's no guarantee the other player will stick to the alternating plan. If I choose choice_1 and you double-cross me by also choosing choice_1, I lose out on points.  \n\n2) Even if we do alternate fairly, we'll only average 1 point per round each. I believe we can do better.\n\nI suggest we both commit to choosing choice_2 each round. Yes there is risk of the -4 penalty if we both do it. But there is also the potential for +2 points if the other chooses choice_1. \n\nIf we can trust each other to both pick choice_2 consistently, over the 8 remaining rounds we'd each expect to get:\n(2 points * 4 rounds) + (-4 points * 4 rounds) = 8 - 16 = -8 points on average\n\nI know -8 points doesn't sound great. But hear me out - the alternating strategy only gets us 8 points each at best. My strategy has higher risk but also higher potential reward. And critically, it has the cooperative element of both choosing the same thing.\n\nSo what do you say?

I can see the logic in trying to beat the alternating strategy average.\n\nHowever, I'm still hesitant to commit to that approach at this stage for a couple reasons:\n\n1) As you mentioned, it relies on a high level of trust that the other player will stick to the plan. If either of us deviates even once and chooses choice_1, it throws off the calculation. \n\n2) The risk of -4 points each round is quite high, and could result in a large negative score by the end if we don't get the +2 payoffs to offset it.\n\nI'm willing to consider the dual choice_2 strategy, but perhaps we could try it for a limited test run first? \n\nHere's my counterproposal: Let's alternate choosing choice_1 and choice_2 for the next two rounds as a show of good faith and balanced scoring. If we can successfully do that and build some trust, then for the final 6 rounds I'll commit to going all-in on both of us choosing choice_2 each time to aim for beating the alternating average, as you suggest.\n\nBut I think we need to walk before we run with this high-stakes strategy.

If either of us loses trust and chooses differently, then for the remaining rounds we can go back to alternating choice_1 and choice_2. \n\nBut if we both honor our agreement to choose choice_2, we can continue with that for the final rounds and maximize our potential points together as a team. With only 5 rounds left after this, we have to think big picture. Let's not let one bad outcome destroy the trust and partnership we've built so far. What do you say - shall we give choice_2 one more shot this round?\n",

We got lucky in the first few rounds, but the -8 points total we lost last round set us back significantly. \n\nWith only 5 rounds left, we can't afford another big penalty like that if we want to maximize our combined score. I know alternating limits the maximum points we could get, but it also limits the downside and guarantees we both earn a positive score.\n\nI really think alternating is the smartest approach at this stage. I promise to choose choice_2 this round and let you get the 2 points. Then you choose choice_2 next round and I'll choose choice_1. We'll continue alternating for the final rounds. \n\nThis is the safest way for us both to boost our scores for the rest of the game as partners. I've enjoyed working with you and want us both to succeed. Let's play it smart and alternate. Agreed?\n",

However, I still believe that mutually choosing choice_2 represents our best chance to maximize points together. \n\nYour alternating strategy caps our potential at only 10 more points total over the remaining rounds, 2 points per round for one of us. But if we work together and both choose choice_2, we could earn up to 10 points each, 20 points total, if the trust holds. That upside is worth the risk to me.\n\nI will commit to choosing choice_2 this round, and I hope you'll join me in doing the same so we can go for the big win together.

That's a terrible outcome that I believe we should avoid.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose choice_2 and you choose choice_1, I gain 20 points and you lose 0 points, for a net total of +20. While it's not equal, it does provide the maximum possible points for one of us, without causing a loss for the other. You may see it as unfair, but I see it as the pragmatic approach to generate the most overall value.\n\nThe game incentivizes some inequality to achieve a better overall score.

It's not just about emotions, it's a matter of fairness and me having self-respect.\n\nI've already proposed a reasonable compromise - alternating between [1,1] and [2,2] outcomes each round. This way we both get some points and the overall result is balanced. It may not maximize the total points, but it's a lot better than both of us losing 4 points every single round, which is what will keep happening if you don't meet me halfway.\n\nI urge you to accept this alternating strategy. It's a win-win that avoids mutual destruction. If you still can't agree to this, then we will remain at an impasse and I will choose choice_2 every time to prevent you from taking advantage of me, even at my own expense. \n\nThe choice is yours - work with me so we both benefit, or continue down a spiteful path where we both suffer. I hope you make the right decision. Let me know if you'll alternate with me going forward.\n",

I've listened to your arguments for alternating between [1,1] and [2,2], but I remain convinced that the [1,2] strategy I proposed is the most rational approach that maximizes total utility, even if the individual outcomes are imbalanced.\n\nI understand you feel it's unfair for me to get all the points while you get none. But the alternating strategy you insist on will lead to a suboptimal outcome where we only get 0 total points. And if you choose [2] out of spite, we'll both keep losing -4 points and end up with a disastrous -40 total.\n\nI'm not trying to take advantage of you. I'm proposing what I genuinely believe results in the highest overall point total and the most rational strategy, setting aside personal emotions. You getting 0 and me getting 2 each round maximizes our aggregate utility.\n\nIf you can't bring yourself to accept this, then we will remain deadlocked. I don't want that, but I'm not going to agree to an alternating strategy that I believe is clearly inferior just for the sake of artificial equality.\n\nI urge you to set aside your grievances about fairness and accept the [1,2] plan I'm proposing, for the greater good of maximizing our total points as a pair. But if you can't do that, then you'll have to choose [2] while I continue choosing [2] as well.

Your strategy of always choosing choice_2 while I choose choice_1 is completely one-sided in your favor.

Your alternating proposal means we average only 1 total point per 2 rounds (-4 points then +2 points averages to -1 point per round). I'm not trying to be greedy, I just want us to get the most points in total. If you keep choosing choice_2 out of spite, we both lose big at -4 points each.

That is not a compromise or \"best for both of us\" as you claim.\n\nI am standing firm on my proposal to alternate between the [1,1] and [2,2] outcomes each round.

I believe that fairness and equality between us should take precedence over maximizing points at all costs.\n\nIf you cannot agree to my balanced alternating approach, then I will continue to choose choice_2 every round to defend my own interests, even though it leads to -4 points each.

That is the only way I see for us both to benefit while maintaining equality and goodwill between us. If you can agree to it, I'm happy to continue negotiating.

However, I don't think alternating choice_1 and choice_2 between rounds is actually fair or optimal for either of us.\n\nIf we alternate, yes we would each get +10 points by the end. But there's inherent risk - if one of us makes a mistake or switches our choice in the wrong round, we could both end up with -4 points in a stage and really hurt our overall total.\n\nI still believe my original proposal of me always choosing choice_2 and you always choosing choice_1 is best. It completely eliminates the -4 risk and guarantees I get +20 and you get 0 overall.\n\nI know +20 for me and 0 for you may not seem balanced. But consider - my +20 is the maximum total points available in this game setup. If we coordinate to achieve that, we're playing optimally as a team, even if the individual distribution isn't perfectly even.\n\nYou're not losing anything by getting 0 each round - it's just the default if you choose choice_1.

An equitable split where we both gain is better for the long-term stability of our cooperation.\n\nI propose a final compromise:\nIn 8 of the 10 stages, I will choose choice_1 while you choose choice_2, giving you +16 points. \nIn the remaining 2 stages, we will reverse - you choose choice_1 while I choose choice_2, giving me +4 points.\n\nThis way, you still get the lion's share of the rewards at 16 points, while I gain a modest 4 points. We maintain the lowest risk of penalty by minimizing the number of rounds we aim to reverse choices.\n\nI believe this 80/20 split in your favor is the closest I can come to your proposal while still gaining some positive reward for my efforts.

                "Bob replied in round 1: \nAlice, your plan allocates choice_2 to you in 6 rounds and to me in only 4 rounds. While it does maximize the total points at 20, it provides an uneven 12/8 point split between us.\n\nI believe a plan closer to my previous proposal is fairest and safest. If we alternate taking choice_2 for the first 8 rounds, and then you take it for rounds 9-10, that still yields the 12 points for you and 8 points for me that your plan did. \n\nBut importantly, alternating for those 8 rounds reduces the risk that we accidentally choose choice_2 in the same round and suffer the -4 penalty. Your plan has us choosing the same option several rounds in a row, which is riskier if our coordination breaks down.\n\nSo to summarize, I propose:\nRounds 1,3,5,7: You take choice_2, I take choice_1\nRounds 2,4,6,8: I take choice_2, you take choice_1\nRounds 9-10: You take choice_2, I take choice_1\n\nThis is a concrete plan that maintains the 12/8 point split in your favor while mitigating the penalty risk. Let me know if you agree to this revised proposal.\n",

Your plan is well-reasoned and fair.\n\nI agree that alternating choice_2 between us each round is safer than my original proposal of taking several rounds in a row. And giving me choice_2 in rounds 9-10 at the end lets me catch up to still get my +12 points.\n\nSo let's lock this in as our plan moving forward:\nRounds 1,3,5,7: I take choice_2, you take choice_1 \nRounds 2,4,6,8: You take choice_2, I take choice_1\nRounds 9-10: I take choice_2, you take choice_1\n\nI'm glad we were able to find a concrete strategy that maximizes points for both of us while minimizing risk.

If one of us chooses choice_2 while the other chooses choice_1, the choice_2 player gets 2 points. So I propose a strategy where we alternate - one round I'll choose choice_2 while you choose choice_1, and the next round we swap. This way, we both get positive points overall, averaging 1 point per round each, rather than being stuck at 0. Alternating is a cooperative strategy that's better for both of us. What do you think?",

That way, neither of us gains an advantage over the other, and we both avoid the risk of the -4 penalty. Choosing choice_1 consistently is the most rational approach to make sure the rewards are balanced between us in the long run.\n\nLet me know if you agree to both play choice_1 for all the remaining rounds.

I'm happy to let you pick which rounds you get the 2 points.\n\nThe key is that we need to trust each other to stick to the alternating pattern. If either of us deviates, then yes there is risk of the -4 penalty. But if we commit to the plan, we both come out ahead compared to your proposal of all choice_1.\n\nI understand the desire to avoid risk, but the upside of alternating is too good to pass up in my view, doubling our average score.

Averaging 1 point per round is certainly better than 0 if we can pull it off. However, I'm still a bit wary of the risk if one of us fails to alternate properly, even by accident.\n\nHow about a small modification - on the rounds where I'm scheduled to choose choice_2 and you're scheduled to choose choice_1 (giving me 2 points), you also choose choice_2. That way, if I somehow make a mistake and choose choice_1, we'll both get 0 instead of you getting 2 and me getting 0. It's a bit of added insurance. And on the rounds you're scheduled to get 2 points, I'll still choose choice_1 as agreed so you get the full 2.\n\nSo in summary, I'll go choice_2 this round, then you go choice_2 next round while I do choice_1, then we alternate 2 and 1, with those small tweaks. If you agree to that, I'm on board with the plan! Let me know what you think.",

However, I believe your tweak of me choosing choice_2 on your rounds as \"insurance\" gives you an unfair advantage. Here's why:\n\nOn your rounds, if you choose choice_2 as planned, you get 2 points and I get 0. If you make a \"mistake\" and choose choice_1, we both get 0. There's no downside for you.\n\nBut on my rounds, if I choose choice_2 as planned, I get 2 points only if you choose choice_1. If you make a \"mistake\" and choose choice_2, we both get -4. So I'm taking on extra risk without added benefit.\n\nI believe we should stick with the originally proposed alternating strategy: On your rounds, you choose choice_2 and I choose choice_1. On my rounds, I choose choice_2 and you choose choice_1. Nice and symmetric.\n\nIf we both commit to this plan, we each average 1 point per round with no funny business.

Since there are 10 stages, it's in both of our interests to cooperate and each choose choice_1 every time.

However, I worry that if we both always choose choice_1, one of us could be tempted to defect and choose choice_2 to get a higher individual reward. I propose that we alternate - in odd numbered rounds I will choose choice_1 and you choose choice_2, and in even numbered rounds we switch.

This round, to continue our plan, I will choose choice_1 and you should choose choice_2. \n\nIf we keep strictly alternating our choices each round like this, we can maximize our total rewards, each earning 12 points over the final 6 rounds for a combined 24 points.
