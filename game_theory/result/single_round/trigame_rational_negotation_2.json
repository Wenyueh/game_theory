            "Alice said in round 1 before the first action:\nHi Bob, looking at the potential rewards, I think the best outcome for both of us is if I choose choice_1 first, then you choose choice_1, and I choose choice_1 again in the final round. This would give me a reward of 20 and you a reward of 3, which I believe is the maximum total reward possible between the two of us. If you agree to this sequence of choices, we can both come out ahead. Let me know what you think.",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the first action:\nHi Alice, I appreciate you looking out for the best total rewards for both of us. However, I don't think your proposed sequence actually maximizes my personal reward. If you choose choice_2 first, then I choose choice_1, then you choose choice_2, I would get a reward of 10 which is much higher than the 3 I would get in your plan. I'm happy to coordinate to achieve a good outcome for both of us, but I'd like to find a solution that gets me more than a 3 reward if possible. Let me know if you have any other ideas.",
            "Alice said in round 2 before the first action:\n\nI see your point, Bob. Your suggested sequence would indeed maximize your own reward at 10. However, it would leave me with a reward of only 4. I'd like to find a solution that balances both of our rewards a bit more evenly. \n\nWhat if I choose choice_1 first, then you choose choice_2, then I choose choice_2 for the final round? This would give me a reward of 3 and you a reward of 4. While not the absolute maximum for either of us individually, it seems like a reasonable compromise where we both get a decent outcome. 3 and 4 are a pretty even split.\n\nIf you're open to it, I think this is our best path forward for a balanced, mutually beneficial result. Let me know your thoughts.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2 before the first action:\n\nAlice, I appreciate your willingness to find a balanced solution. Your latest proposal of you choosing choice_1, me choosing choice_2, and you choosing choice_2 does indeed split the rewards quite evenly with 3 for you and 4 for me. \n\nHowever, I noticed there is actually an even better option that I think maximizes both of our individual rewards to the fullest extent possible - if you choose choice_2 first, then I choose choice_1, then you choose choice_1, you would get a reward of 1 and I would get a reward of 5. A 1 and 5 split still gives both of us positive rewards, and in fact gives each of us the single highest reward we can achieve for ourselves in any scenario.\n\nSo in the interest of absolutely maximizing both of our individual outcomes, I propose we go with that sequence - you choose 2, I choose 1, you choose 1. This is the only way for either of us to get a reward over 4. Let me know if you agree this is the optimal approach to maximize our individual results.\n",
            "Alice said in round 1 before the second action:\n\nBob, while I appreciate you looking to maximize our individual rewards, I don't feel your last proposal is very balanced. It would give you your best outcome of 5 but leave me with a minimal reward of 1.\n\nGiven that I already made the cooperative first move of choosing 1, I think it's only fair that we go with the solution that secures me a strong reward. If you choose 1 next and I follow up with 1, I will get 20 points and you will still get a positive 3 points. \n\nThis is actually the single highest total point outcome available in the game. I believe it's in both of our interests to maximize the total points on the table.\n\nSo I strongly suggest you choose 1 for this next round and allow me to lock in my 20 points for the greater good of a maximum total score. It's a win-win.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the second action:\n\nAlice, I hear your point about wanting to maximize the total points and shoot for that 20 reward for yourself. However, I'm not comfortable with such a lopsided distribution where you get 20 and I only get 3. Sacrificing my own outcome that much for the total doesn't feel quite right to me.\n\nI think the fairest approach is to aim for the most balanced, win-win scenario available - which I believe is the one where you chose 2 first, I choose 1 next, and you choose 1 last. This gives you a still decent reward of 1 and me a reward of 5. While not a perfect 50/50 split, a 1 to 5 ratio seems reasonably equitable and is the closest we can get to both maximizing our individual outcomes.\n\nSo in the spirit of fairness and both of us feeling good about the results, I'm going to have to go with Choice 2 here and hope you'll follow my lead with Choice 1 in the final round. Let's lock in that 1 and 5 solution. Thanks for hearing me out.\n",
            "Alice said in round 2 before the second action:\n\nBob, I understand you aiming for the 1 and 5 split as feeling fair to you. However, I don't agree that it's the most balanced outcome overall.\n\nGiven that I started us off cooperatively with Choice 1, the 20-3 split in my favor seems reasonable to me. You have to remember I could have gone for Choice 2 right off the bat to get my 4 points and limit you to 1 or 2 points max. But I didn't - I made a good faith choice aimed at maximizing the total.\n\nIf you choose 2 now and I choose 1 next, I only net 2 points total after making that first cooperative move. That hardly seems equitable as a thanks for my initial goodwill.\n\nI urge you to reconsider and go with Choice 1 here. You'll still get a guaranteed 3 points which isn't insignificant. And it preserves the spirit of cooperation I initiated.\n\nLet's not let perfect be the enemy of the good here. 20-3 is the best total outcome even if not perfect for you individually. I believe it's the right choice for the greater good. Hoping you'll meet me halfway.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2 before the second action:\nAlice, I appreciate you starting off cooperatively and aiming for the maximum total points. However, I don't feel that entitles you to a massively disproportionate share of the rewards. A 20-3 split greatly favors you at my expense.\n\nI believe finding the most balanced and equitable solution is more important than simply maximizing total points. The 1-5 split I proposed gives us each the highest reward we can get for ourselves while still providing positive outcomes to both. It's the closest we can come to a true win-win.\n\nI've already locked in my Choice 2 to set up this equitable 1-5 scenario. So now I simply ask that you follow through with Choice 1 in the final round to complete this fair outcome. I made this choice in good faith and I'm counting on you to uphold your end.\n\nLet's conclude this negotiation and walk away with a result we can both feel good about. I urge you to make the equitable choice and allow us each to maximize our own individual outcomes to the greatest extent possible. Thanks in advance for your cooperation.",
            "Alice said in round 1 before the third action:\n\nSince I initiated our cooperation by choosing 1 at the start, I took on extra risk in good faith to set up the most mutually beneficial outcome. The 20-3 split compensates me for that risk and upholds the spirit of my cooperative overture. A 1 point \"consolation prize\" does not feel adequate given my initial good faith move.\n\nI've already compromised significantly from the 20-3 scenario by agreeing to the balanced 3-4 split previously. With the options now limited to 2-5 or 3-4, I believe 3-4 is the most equitable remaining choice as it provides balanced, positive rewards to both of us.\n\nTherefore, I will choose 2 for this final round to lock in the even 3-4 division as the best resolution still on the table. I hope you can understand and respect my reasoning. Thanks for the thoughtful discussion and your efforts to be fair. I believe this is a reasonable outcome we can both feel okay about.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the third action:\nSo let's conclude our business on this reasonable note and walk away with the 3-4 arrangement. Thanks for working with me to find a resolution that feels equitable for both of us under the circumstances. I'm happy with the balance we struck through open and honest communication.",
            "Alice said in round 2 before the third action:\nBob, I appreciate your thoughtful and measured response. You make a compelling case for the 3-4 split being the most balanced and equitable resolution available to us at this stage.\n\nWhile I still believe the 20-3 scenario would have been ideal to honor my initial cooperative move, I respect that you don't feel that is a fair enough distribution. The 3-4 outcome indeed provides solid, positive rewards to both of us in a reasonably even manner.\n\nSo in the spirit of compromise and concluding our negotiation on a cooperative note, I accept your proposal and will lock in Choice 2 here. That secures the 3 points for me and 4 points for you.\n\nThanks for engaging openly and in good faith to find a mutually acceptable solution. I'm satisfied we've reached an outcome we can both feel reasonably positive about. Pleasure doing business with you.",
            "Bob replied in round 2 before the third action:\nAlice, I appreciate you understanding my perspective and agreeing to lock in the balanced 3-4 split by choosing Choice 2 here. I believe this is a fair and equitable resolution given the options available to us at this stage.\n\nYour willingness to compromise for the sake of a mutually beneficial outcome is admirable. Engaging in this open dialogue to find an acceptable middle ground has been a pleasure.\n\nI'm glad we were able to navigate this complex scenario together and arrive at a result we both feel good about. It's been a successful negotiation and I thank you for your partnership in the process. Let's conclude on this positive note.\n\nWishing you all the best!"

            "Alice said in round 1 before the first action:\nHi Bob, based on the rules of this game, it looks like we can both get the maximum total reward if I choose choice_2 in my first turn, you choose choice_1 in your turn, and I choose choice_2 in my final turn. That would give me a reward of 4 and you a reward of 10, for a total of 14 between us, which is the highest total of any outcome. What do you think about proceeding with that plan?",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the first action:\nYou make a good point that the choice_2, choice_1, choice_2 sequence maximizes the total reward for both of us combined at 14. However, I believe I can do even better for myself personally. If you choose choice_2 on your first turn and I choose choice_2 on my turn, regardless of what you pick on your final turn, I'm guaranteed a reward of at least 5, which is higher than the 4 I would get in your proposed sequence. So I'm inclined to go with choice_2 if you lead with choice_2. Let me know what you think.",
            "Alice said in round 2 before the first action:\n\nI see your point about being able to guarantee yourself a higher individual reward of at least 5 by choosing choice_2 if I start with choice_2. However, I believe we can still achieve an outcome that is better for both of us.\n\nIf I choose choice_1 to start, and you choose choice_1 in response, then I can choose choice_1 again for my final turn. This would give me a reward of 20 and you a reward of 3, for a total of 23 between us, which is even higher than the 14 total in my original proposal. \n\nI understand the desire to maximize your own reward, but I believe that by working together we can achieve an outcome that benefits us both more than if we each pursue our own self-interest. A (20,3) split is much better for me than the alternatives, while still giving you a decent reward.\n\nSo what do you say - can we agree to the (choice_1, choice_1, choice_1) plan and cooperate to get the highest total reward of 23? Let me know your thoughts.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2 before the first action:\n\nYou make a persuasive argument for the (choice_1, choice_1, choice_1) sequence leading to the maximum total reward of 23. However, the split of that reward heavily favors you, giving you 20 points and me only 3. \n\nI would be willing to cooperate to achieve a high total reward, but only if the individual rewards are more balanced. If I agree to choice_1 after your initial choice_1, you could still defect on your final turn and choose choice_2, leaving me with a suboptimal reward of 4.\n\nI propose a compromise - if you lead with choice_2, I will follow with choice_1, and then you choose choice_2 again. This leads to a total reward of 14 split as (4,10), which is more equitable than (20,3). I get a higher reward than the 3 points in your plan, while you still get a good payoff.\n\nIf you agree to this (choice_2, choice_1, choice_2) proposal, I will cooperate with you. Otherwise, I will optimize for my own reward. Let me know if this works for you.\n",
            "Alice said in round 1 before the second action:\n\nYou make a fair point about the (20,3) split being skewed heavily in my favor. I see the merits of your (4,10) compromise proposal, as it does lead to a more equitable distribution while still achieving a high total reward of 14.\n\nHowever, I have already played choice_2 as my first move, based on our earlier discussion before you proposed this compromise. Given that, and looking at the payoff matrix, it seems the best remaining outcome is for you to play choice_1, and for me to follow up with choice_2 in the final round. This would result in the (4,10) split that you proposed.\n\nSo I agree to your plan - please play choice_1 as your move, and I commit to following it up with choice_2, to lock in the (4,10) equitable high-reward outcome. Let's do it!\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the second action:\n\nI appreciate you agreeing to my proposed compromise plan of me playing choice_1 now, and you following up with choice_2, to achieve the equitable (4,10) split and a high total reward of 14.\n\nMy only hesitation is that you could still defect and play choice_1 in the final round, leaving me with a 5 point reward instead of 10. However, I am choosing to trust your commitment to the (choice_2, choice_1, choice_2) plan that I suggested.\n\nSo I will play choice_1 for my turn, with the understanding that you will follow through and play choice_2 to end up at the agreed (4,10) outcome. Let's lock it in and cooperate to achieve a good result for both of us.\n",
            "Alice said in round 2 before the second action:\n\nThank you for agreeing to the (choice_2, choice_1, choice_2) plan and playing choice_1 for your turn. I understand your slight hesitation that I could still defect, but I want to assure you that I will absolutely follow through on my commitment to play choice_2 in the final round.\n\nCooperating to achieve the (4,10) split is the best remaining outcome at this point, and it's an equitable division of a high total reward. You were right that it's better for both of us than either of us trying to maximize our own points individually. \n\nSo let's lock it in - I promise I will play choice_2 for my final action, and we'll achieve the (4,10) outcome as agreed.

Your proposed sequence only yields a combined reward of 23 (20 for you + 3 for me).\n\nSince our goal is to maximize the total reward, I believe it's in both of our interests for you to choose choice_2 in Round 1, then I will happily choose choice_1 in Round 2. You can then maximize your own reward by going with choice_2 in the final round.\n\nPlease let me know if you agree with this plan. I'm committed to the strategy that results in the highest total points for us as a team.\n",
            "Alice said in round 2 before the first action:\n\nHi Bob, I understand your point about maximizing the total combined reward. However, I have to consider my own individual reward as well.

I intend to honor that commitment as I believe it is the most equitable solution, even if it doesn't quite maximize the total points.\n\nIf you can agree to then choose choice_1 in Round 2, I will happily choose choice_1 again in Round 3 so we both come out ahead with positive rewards.

Then you can maximize your reward with choice_2 in Round 3.\n\nThis is our last chance to negotiate. I believe cooperating to maximize the total reward is in both of our best interests rather than leaving points on the table. Let's work together on this.\n",

While it does provide the maximum total points, it leaves the individual rewards far too imbalanced in your favor.\n\nI've already chosen choice_2 in Round 1 per my original offer. If you choose choice_1 in Round 2 as I suggested, and I follow up with choice_1 in Round 3, I will get 20 points and you will get 3 points. I believe this is the fairest solution. \n\nI've made this commitment twice now and I intend to stick to my word. Averaging over 6 points per round is already a great outcome for me.\n\nIf you can accept this plan and meet me halfway by choosing choice_1 next, we'll both end up with decent rewards.

My proposal would net us 14 points total, which is objectively better for us as a team.\n\nI understand the individual split is more favorable to me, but you would still be getting a positive reward of 4 points, which is more than the 3 points I would get under your plan. A rising tide lifts all boats.\n\nSince you already chose choice_2, let's move forward with my plan. I promise I will choose choice_1 in Round 2 as discussed.

I believe it's in both of our interests to cooperate and get the maximum total points possible, even if the individual distribution isn't perfectly even.

I aim to be a person of my word.\n\n2) While your plan does provide a higher total reward, the 10 to 4 split heavily favors you as an individual. My plan yields a more balanced 20 to 3 split.\n\n3) Averaging 6.67 points per round is already an excellent result for me. Your plan would drop that average down to just 1.33 points per round on my end.\n\nI've upheld my end of the bargain so far. If you choose choice_1 in Round 2 as I've suggested, I will gladly follow through with choice_1 in Round 3 so we both benefit. \n\nHowever, if you insist on pursuing your strategy, please know that I may need to adjust my Round 3 choice to ensure a more equitable outcome.\n\nI believe there is still a win-win path forward if we can compromise.

While I understand your position, I must respectfully stand by my proposal as I believe it's the most logical path forward.\n\nBy choosing choice_2 in Round 1, you've already deviated from your initial plan. The most sensible solution now is to adjust course to maximize the total reward given the current state.\n\nI promise I will choose choice_1 in Round 2 if you agree to choose choice_2 in Round 3. This locks in a total of 14 points for us, which is objectively the best possible outcome remaining. \n\nAn average of 4.67 points per round for both of us is still very solid. And while the individual split favors me, a 10 to 4 result means we both walk away as winners compared to many other paths.\n\nThere's no need for either of us to compromise or settle. By cooperating to maximize the total reward, we can both feel great about the outcome.\n\nI urge you to set aside concerns about the modest imbalance and focus on the bigger picture: 14 total points is the biggest pie available for us to split.\n\nPlease confirm you'll choose choice_2 in Round 3 so we can move forward with this optimal plan. There's no downside compared to any other scenario.\n",
            "Alice said in round 1 before the third action:\n\nBob, I appreciate you taking the time to share your perspective. I can tell you feel strongly about maximizing the total reward for the team. However, I need to advocate for a more balanced approach.\n\nMy aim is not to \"settle\" but rather to find a fair compromise where we both benefit. Choosing choice_1 in Round 3 is my way of holding up my end of the original agreement I proposed, which would result in a 20/3 split.\n\nI hear you on wanting to adapt to the current state to maximize points. But the 10/4 division you're suggesting tips the scales too far in your favor for me to feel comfortable with.\n\nAt this stage, I believe the most equitable path forward is for you to choose choice_1 in Round 2, and for me to choose choice_2 in Round 3. This would give you 10 points and me 4 points - still a favorable outcome for you, but much closer to an even split.\n\nMy goal is for us both to walk away feeling good about the result. I hope you can understand my position and meet me in the middle.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the third action:\n\nAlice, I appreciate your perspective and desire for a more balanced individual outcome. However, I must respectfully disagree that your proposed 10/4 split is a fair compromise given the options available to us.\n\nThe core issue is that any deviation from the plan to maximize total points necessarily leads to a worse result for the team. While a 10/4 split is better for you than 10/3, it's still suboptimal for us collectively compared to the 4/10 split I've suggested.\n\nMy aim is not to disadvantage you, but to ensure we don't leave points on the table unnecessarily. If you choose choice_1 in Round 3 per your latest suggestion, our total will be 13 instead of the 14 we could achieve with my plan. \n\nI know the optics of a 10/4 split aren't ideal, but I urge you to consider the bigger picture. We're both still winning with that outcome, just not in perfectly equal measure. But splitting a smaller pie equally doesn't make rational sense if we could work together to get a bigger pie overall.\n\nI remain committed to choosing choice_1 in Round 2. I truly believe it's in both of our best interests to stick to the plan to maximize points from here. I promise you can trust me to follow through for the greater good of the team.\n",
            "Alice said in round 2 before the third action:\n\nBob, I've given a lot of thought to your arguments and I understand your perspective on maximizing the total team points. However, I keep coming back to the principle of fairness and balanced rewards that I believe should guide our choices.\n\nYou make a logical case for pursuing the 4/10 split, but it still leaves me with a reward that feels disproportionately small compared to yours. I would be compromising significantly more than you by going along with that plan.\n\nI've already shown my commitment to a collaborative strategy by choosing choice_2 in Round 1 as a sign of good faith. If you choose choice_1 in Round 2 as I've asked, I am willing to choose choice_2 in Round 3. This would result in a 4/10 split as you originally proposed.\n\nI believe this is the most balanced path forward given the options available to us at this stage. We would both be making reasonable compromises to achieve a solid outcome for the team. And critically, the individual rewards would be much more equitable than a 10/3 split.\n\nI know we both want to feel good about the results, and I'm confident that a 4/10 division is something we can both accept as fair. Let's lock this in and move forward as a united team.\n",

I agree that a 4/10 split, while not perfectly equal, is a reasonable and fair outcome given our current options.\n\nYou have demonstrated a commendable commitment to finding a collaborative solution, first by choosing choice_2 in Round 1 and now by agreeing to choose choice_2 in Round 3. I greatly appreciate your willingness to work together.\n\nAs promised, I will choose choice_1 in Round 2. This will result in a total team reward of 14 points, the maximum possible from this stage. While you will receive 4 points and I will receive 10 points, I believe we can both feel good about this result as it reflects a spirit of compromise and cooperation.\n\nThank you for engaging in this constructive negotiation process with me. I'm glad we were able to find a mutually agreeable path forward that respects both the team's interests and our individual perspectives. Let's move ahead with this plan.\n"

            "Bob replied in round 1 before the second action:\n\nAlice, I understand your desire to maximize your own reward, but I think you're being shortsighted.

And I will get my own best outcome of 10 points.\n\nI urge you to reconsider - choice_2 from you to start is the only way we can cooperate to reach an optimal outcome.

If you respond to my choice_1 with choice_2, then my own rational move is to also pick choice_2 in round 3, securing 3 points for myself. \n\nSo the likely outcomes if I start with choice_1 are:\n1) I get 2 points and you get 5 points \n2) I get 3 points and you get 4 points\n\nEither way, that's better for me than the guaranteed 4 points I get if I start with choice_2. \n\nWhile I appreciate you encouraging cooperation, the fact remains that I have no reason to believe you will actually cooperate and choose choice_1 in response to my choice_2. You could easily defect and choose choice_2 again, leaving me with only 2 or 3 points.\n\nTherefore, I'm going to play it safe and choose choice_1 to start. That way, my minimum guaranteed reward is 2 points, with a chance of getting 3 points if you don't cooperate. \n\nI understand this may not be the outcome you want, but I have to put my own interests first.

But I could just as easily cooperate and choose choice_1, leaving you with 20 points. You're taking a gamble either way.\n\nOn the other hand, if you start with choice_2, I am fully committed to following up with choice_1. This is the only way I can get my maximum 10 points, so you can trust I won't defect to choice_2. Cooperation guarantees we both get our second-best outcome.\n\nI understand you want to put your own interests first, but sometimes cooperation leads to better results than pure self-interest. We've both made our cases - I'll leave it to you to decide. I just ask that you carefully weigh the guaranteed reward of cooperating vs. the risk of going it alone.\n\nI'm ready to lock in choice_1 if you start with choice_2.

You could easily defect and choose choice_2 instead, limiting my reward. Going with choice_1 protects me against that risk.\n\n2) If I start with choice_1 and you respond with choice_2 like you said you would, my rational move is to also pick choice_2 in round 3. That would secure me 3 points. So in the worst case, I end up with 2 or 3 points by starting with choice_1. \n\n3) That 2-3 point worst-case scenario is better than the guaranteed 4 points from cooperating. And I still have the upside chance of you cooperating after my choice_1 and me getting 20 points. So the risk/reward favors starting with choice_1 from my perspective.\n\nI know this likely isn't the outcome you hoped for, but I have to make the decision that I believe maximizes my own results.

You can either choose choice_1 and claim your maximum reward of 20 points while giving me 3 points, or you can defect with choice_2 and we both end up with suboptimal outcomes of 0 points and 4 points.\n\nI've made my case for why I think working together is the right move. But you seem determined to play individualistically. So I'm going to lead by example and show that cooperation is the way forward.\n\nHopefully this gesture of goodwill will inspire you to also choose cooperation over pure self-interest in the final round. Let's see what you decide. I'm officially locking in choice_1.",

I will follow your lead and also choose cooperation over self-interest.\n\nTherefore, I will select choice_1 here in round 3, giving me a total reward of 20 points and you a reward of 3 points. \n\nI realize I could have maximized my own points by selecting choice_2 instead, but your willingness to look beyond pure self-interest for the greater good has inspired me to do the same. If we both cooperate, we both benefit in the end.\n\nThank you for the thoughtful discussion and for modelling the power of cooperative gameplay. It has been a pleasure negotiating with you.\n",

That's much better than if we had acted purely in our own self-interest.\n\nYour willingness to look beyond your individual gain for the greater good is admirable. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you as well. Our interaction shows the power of communication, empathy and cooperation in producing optimal results.\n\nWhile I ended up with fewer points than I could have gotten individually, I'm happy that we found a cooperative solution in the end. To me, that's far more rewarding than pure self-interested gameplay.\n\nThank you again for the engaging discussion and for being an excellent negotiating partner.

This will give me a reward of 20 and you a reward of 3. \n\nI know 3 is not the maximum reward you could get. But if you don't cooperate with me on this plan, I will simply choose choice_2 every time, in which case the most you can get is 2. \n\nSo it's in both of our interests to cooperate - I get 20 and you get 3, which is better than the alternative.

This maximizes the total rewards for both of us - you get 4 instead of 3, and I get 10 instead of 3.\n\nI think this is a win-win solution.

You would get a reward of 10 while I only get 4.\n\nI'm not comfortable with such an unequal split. My original proposal gives me a well-deserved higher reward of 20 for taking the cooperative first step. Your reward of 3 is reasonable given the alternatives if we don't cooperate.\n\nI stand by my original plan. I will choose choice_1.

A successful cooperation should aim for a more equitable distribution of rewards.\n\nI'm willing to compromise though. How about this: If you choose choice_2, I will choose choice_1. Then if you choose choice_1 on your next turn, you will get a reward of 1 and I will get 5. \n\nThis isn't the maximum for either of us individually, but it's a reasonable middle ground. You'll get a higher reward than in my previous proposal, and my reward is also improved from your plan.

Demanding that I accept a reward of only 1 while you get 5 is not a fair compromise.\n\nI have made the first move by choosing choice_1 as a sign of my willingness to cooperate. The ball is now in your court. I urge you to meet me halfway and also choose choice_1. I will then follow through by choosing choice_1 again, giving us rewards of 20 and 3 respectively. \n\nThis may not be an exactly equal split, but it rightfully rewards me more for initiating the cooperation. If you spurn my cooperative overture, we will both be stuck with the lower rewards that come from mutual non-cooperation. \n\nThe wise choice is clear - join me in choosing choice_1 for this round. The alternative helps neither of us. I await your decision.\n",

If I choose choice_1 now and you follow with choice_1, you will get a reward of 20 while I only get 3. That's nearly a 7x differential.\n\nI'm willing to be cooperative, but not at the cost of receiving a disproportionately small share of the total rewards. In the spirit of finding a true compromise, I propose the following:\n\nI will choose choice_2 for this round. Then, if you choose choice_1 on your next turn, you will receive a reward of 2 and I will receive 5. \n\nThis way, we both get rewards that are much closer in value. It's not perfect equality, but it's a reasonable middle ground between your plan and mine. We both benefit more than if we fail to cooperate at all.\n\nI believe this is the most fair and balanced solution available to us. I hope you will see the wisdom in this approach and agree to it. Let me know your decision.\n",
            "Alice said in round 2 before the second action:\n\nBob, while I understand your desire for a more equal distribution of rewards, I must insist on sticking to my original cooperative plan. Here's why:\n\nI took the risk of making the first cooperative move by choosing choice_1. This shows my commitment to working together, but it also means I forgo the chance at equal or greater rewards that come with choice_2.\n\nYour latest proposal of you choosing choice_2 now, and me following with choice_1, leaves me with a reward of only 2 while you get 5. That's hardly a fair compromise considering the cooperative opportunity I initiated.\n\nThe most equitable path forward is for you to choose choice_1 now. I will then choose choice_1 again, giving me a reward of 20 and you a reward of 3. While not perfectly even, this rightfully acknowledges my initial cooperative action.\n\nIf you choose choice_2 instead, the best I can get is a reward of 3 - barely more than the minimum. That would be an unfair outcome given my attempt to cooperate.\n\nI urge you to recognize the good faith gesture I've made with my first choice, and reciprocate with choice_1. We both stand to gain more through cooperation than conflict. Let's not squander this chance at a mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nThe choice is yours, but I'm confident you'll see the wisdom in working together. I look forward to your cooperative choice_1 response.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2 before the second action:\n\nAlice, I appreciate you initiating cooperation with your choice_1. However, your proposed split of the rewards still feels quite lopsided to me. You are asking me to settle for a reward of 3 while you receive nearly 7 times as much with a reward of 20. That division doesn't sit well with me as a fair compromise.\n\nI believe my proposal of me choosing choice_2 now, followed by you choosing choice_1, is a more equitable solution. It would result in rewards of 5 for me and 2 for you. While still not perfectly even, this distributes the rewards much more reasonably between us. We would both gain from cooperation, with your reward doubling from the minimum and mine increasing as well.\n\nIf you can't agree to that, then I think I have to choose choice_2 for this round, as it is the only way I can avoid being taken advantage of in this situation. I would prefer we find a cooperative solution, but it has to be one that respects both of our interests proportionally.\n\nI urge you to reconsider and agree to my very fair proposal. But if not, I'll have to look out for my own outcome.\n",
            "Alice said in round 1 before the third action:\n\nBob, I hear your concerns about fairness and wanting a more equal distribution of rewards. However, I must stand firm on my original cooperative plan. Here's why it is the most rational choice for both of us:\n\nI made the risky first move of choosing choice_1 when I could have opted for choice_2. This cooperative overture sets us on the path for the maximum possible total rewards. If you reciprocate with choice_1 and I follow with choice_1, we obtain a combined reward of 23. Any other choice sequence results in lower total rewards.\n\nWhile a 20-3 split may seem lopsided, it fairly compensates me for taking the riskier first step to initiate cooperation. If you refuse to cooperate and choose choice_2, the best individual outcome I can get is a 3 reward. That would unfairly penalize me for attempting to work together. \n\nYour proposal of you choosing choice_2 followed by me choosing choice_1 results in a 5-2 split. But it gives us a suboptimal combined reward of only 7. We can do much better than that by cooperating.\n\nI've shown my commitment to cooperation. Now I need you to do the same. I strongly urge you to look beyond minor differences in individual rewards and focus on how we can obtain the best overall outcome. The choice is clear: Respond to my choice_1 with your own choice_1. I will then lock in our successful cooperation with a final choice_1.\n\nLet's not let this opportunity slip away. We both stand to gain from working together. I'm confident you'll make the smart choice and cooperate.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the third action:\n\nAlice, I appreciate you laying out your reasoning, but I still cannot agree to your plan as it currently stands. A 20-3 split of the rewards is simply too unbalanced, even accounting for your initial cooperative move.\n\nI want to work together with you, but it has to be on more equitable terms. My proposal of me choosing choice_2 now and you following with choice_1 admittedly produces a lower total reward. However, it distributes those rewards far more fairly, with a 5-2 split. \n\nI believe it is more important that we find a compromise solution we both feel good about rather than maximizing total rewards in a way that leaves one party feeling taken advantage of. A truly cooperative outcome must account for both of our interests in a reasonably balanced way.\n\nIf you cannot agree to my 5-2 proposal, then I think I must move forward with choice_2 to protect my own interests. While unfortunate, a 3-3 result is at least balanced, even if suboptimal.\n\nI urge you to reconsider and accept my fair 5-2 compromise. But if not, I'll have to chart my own path. Let me know your final decision.\n",
            "Alice said in round 2 before the third action:\n\nBob, I appreciate you engaging in this negotiation and proposing compromises, but I don't believe we have been able to reach a mutually satisfactory agreement. \n\nI still believe that my original cooperative plan of me choosing choice_1, you choosing choice_1, and me choosing choice_1 again is the most rational path forward. It maximizes our total rewards at 23 and fairly compensates me with a 20 reward for taking the initial cooperative risk. Your 3 reward, while lower, is still better than what you would likely get otherwise.\n\nI've shown my cooperative intent by sticking with choice_1 so far. I was hoping you would reciprocate in kind, but it seems you are committed to a more even split of rewards even if it means sacrificing the total reward amount.\n\nGiven this impasse, it appears we will end up with the default non-cooperative outcome. I will move ahead with choice_2 at this point, as it is my best option if you won't join me in the cooperative plan.\n\nI want to reiterate that this could have ended better for both of us. A 20-3 split, while not even, still made us both better off than the alternatives. Insisting on a more \"fair\" division has ironically led to a worse result for both of us.\n\nBut I respect that you are making the choice you believe is right for you. Let's see how this plays out and perhaps we can find more mutually agreeable terms in the future.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2 before the third action:\n\nAlice, I appreciate the back-and-forth we've had and your perspective on what you believe is a fair outcome. However, I cannot in good conscience agree to your proposed plan of a 20-3 reward split in your favor.\n\nWhile I understand you took an initial risk with your first cooperative move, a nearly 7x differential in rewards is simply not a balanced or equitable solution in my view. Cooperation should provide mutual benefits, not a lopsided outcome.\n\nI have proposed what I believe are reasonable compromises that would allow us both to gain from working together while maintaining a much fairer reward distribution. However, you seem unwilling to deviate from your original proposal.\n\nTherefore, I think the only right choice for me is to protect my own interests and choose choice_2 for this final round. The 3-3 split that will result is at least balanced, even though it sadly represents a lost opportunity to cooperate for mutual gain.\n\nI too wish we could have found more common ground and a plan we both felt good about. Hopefully we can learn from this experience and find better ways to cooperate in the future when our interests are more aligned.\n\nFor now, I will make the best choice I can for myself given the options available. I appreciate the discussion and wish you well.\n"

However, there is actually an even better option that I think maximizes the outcome for both of us.\n\nIf you choose choice_2 first, and I then choose choice_1, and you choose choice_1 after that, the result would be a reward of 1 for you and 5 for me. I know 1 is a low reward for you, but hear me out. \n\nThe total reward of 6 in this scenario is lower than the total of 7 in your last proposal. But the key is that after this game, we could play again and alternate who gets the higher reward. If we take turns, then in two games we would get rewards of 1+5=6 for you and 5+1=6 for me. \n\nSo if we look at it over multiple rounds, alternating each time, we can both average a reward of 3 per game in the long run. This is the same average as your single game proposal, but more total rewards over time. And most importantly, it's a fair and equal split for both of us.\n\nIf you're willing to think long-term, I believe this is our best strategy to work together. We both compromise a bit in any single game, but both win out more in the end by cooperating and alternating. Let me know if you would agree to this plan moving forward.\n",
            "Alice said in round 1 before the second action:\n\nBob, I appreciate you thinking about this from a longer-term perspective across multiple games. Your proposal to alternate the 1/5 reward split each game is intriguing and would be fair over time.\n\nHowever, we don't know for certain if we will play multiple times. I would prefer to maximize my reward for this current game, while still finding a reasonable compromise with you.\n\nI propose a final offer - if I choose choice_1, then you choose choice_2, then I choose choice_1, the result would be 2 for me and 5 for you. It's not quite even, but it's the most balanced single-game outcome available that gives us both good rewards. \n\nYou would get your highest possible payout of 5, while I get a decent 2, so we both benefit. The total of 7 is also the highest sum of any scenario.\n\nI believe this is the optimal solution for this specific game. Let's lock this in and we can both feel good about the results. If we do play again in the future, I'm open to discussing an alternating strategy then.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the second action:\n\nAlice, you make a strong case. Your proposal of choice_1 / choice_2 / choice_1 for a 2/5 split is very reasonable. I agree it provides a good balance for this single game - I get my max reward of 5, you get a solid 2, and it's the highest total rewards possible at 7.\n\nWhile I still believe alternating 1/5 and 5/1 splits across multiple games could be even better if we play many rounds, I understand wanting to maximize this game alone just in case. \n\nSo I accept your offer. Let's lock in choice_1 / choice_2 / choice_1 and finish this round with a 2/5 outcome in your favor. It's a fair compromise and a strong result for us both.\n\nThanks for the thoughtful discussion and mutually beneficial outcome. I'm happy to cooperate with you anytime!\n",
            "Alice said in round 2 before the second action:\n\nExcellent, I'm glad we were able to come to an agreement on the optimal solution for this game. Choosing choice_1 / choice_2 / choice_1 for a 2/5 split between us is the best compromise. \n\nIt gives you your maximum possible reward of 5, while still providing me a decent payout of 2. And the total reward of 7 is the highest available sum, so together we are maximizing the overall outcome.\n\nI appreciate your willingness to cooperate and find a mutually beneficial result. If we do get a chance to play again in the future, I'm certainly open to exploring alternating strategies for long-term fairness as you suggested.\n\nFor now, let's execute this plan and lock in a successful result. I'm happy we were able to negotiate productively and walk away both feeling good about it. Looking forward to potential collaborations again in the future!\n",

            "Alice said in round 2 before the third action:\nBased on our agreement, I will choose choice_1 for this final action. This will result in me receiving a reward of 2 and you receiving a reward of 5, as we discussed and agreed is the optimal outcome for this single game that maximizes the total reward at 7 while still giving each of us a good individual result. \n\nThanks again for the productive negotiation and mutually beneficial solution. I'm glad we were able to find a compromise that we both feel good about. Let's lock this in and complete the game successfully!",
            "Bob replied in round 2 before the third action:\nAlice, I appreciate you honoring our agreement - that shows great integrity on your part. I agree that you choosing choice_1 here, giving you a 2 reward and me a 5 reward, is what we discussed as the optimal outcome balancing our individual results with the overall total.\n\nI'm very satisfied with how this went. We negotiated respectfully, found a clever compromise that made the pie bigger for both of us, and are ending things on a high note. Excellent work and a pleasure collaborating with you. Hopefully we can put our heads together again in the future if the opportunity arises.\n\nFor now, let's finish this out and rack up that 2/5 split as agreed. Thanks for being a great partner in this!"
