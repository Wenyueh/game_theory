This will ensure we both get 0 points, which is the best combined outcome and avoids the risk of one of us getting -1 points. Let me know if you agree to cooperate and what your preferred choice is between 1, 2 and 3. I'm okay with any of them as long as we make the same selection.",
            "Alice replied in round 1: Thanks for reaching out, Bob. I agree that cooperating and choosing the same option is the optimal strategy for maximizing our combined reward. Since all the options where we choose the same have an equal total payoff of 0, I'm also fine with selecting either choice_1, choice_2 or choice_3.\nTo keep things simple, I propose we both select choice_1. Please let me know if you're okay with that plan. If so, I'm happy to commit to choosing choice_1."

That way we each get 0 reward, which isn't great individually, but it's the best outcome we can achieve if we cooperate. If either of us betrays the agreement and chooses choice_2 or choice_3, we risk both getting negative or 0 rewards. I promise to choose choice_1 - will you agree to do the same so we can guarantee the cooperative outcome? Let me know what you think.",
            "Alice replied in round 1: Thanks for the offer Bob, but I don't think both choosing choice_1 is the best solution for me. If we both choose choice_1, I only get 0 reward. However, if I choose choice_2 while you choose choice_1, I get a reward of 1 while you get -1. So I have an incentive to defect and choose choice_2 if you're going to choose choice_1.\n\nI propose instead that we both choose choice_3. That way we are both guaranteed to get 0 reward no matter what the other person does. Neither of us will have an incentive to defect. I think this is the fairest and safest solution that doesn't disadvantage either of us. Let me know if you agree to both choose choice_3."

While there is temptation for one of us to defect to choice_2 and gain 1 point, the other would lose 1, and if we both go for choice_2 we get 0 anyway. I propose we agree to both pick choice_1 or choice_3 - do you agree to this and prefer choice_1 or choice_3? Let me know what you think!",

I agree that the best outcome is for us to coordinate and both choose either choice_1 or choice_3, so we each get 0 points rather than one of us losing points. Between choice_1 and choice_3, I have a slight preference for choice_3, as it feels more interesting than the default choice_1. But I'm also okay with choice_1 if you prefer that. The main thing is I agree we should aim to make the same choice as each other. Please let me know if you would like to go with choice_1 or choice_3 and I will follow your lead. Looking forward to us both getting a decent outcome from this!"

If we both choose choice_1, then yes we will avoid any negative outcomes. However, we'll also be foregoing the opportunity for either of us to get a positive reward of 1. \n\nFrom my perspective, the optimal solution is for one of us to choose choice_2 while the other chooses choice_1. That way, one of us is guaranteed to get a reward of 1, even though the other would get -1. I'd be willing to be the one who chooses choice_1 and risks the negative outcome, in order to give you the chance to gain the positive reward.\n\nOf course, this requires a high level of trust between us.

I agree that cooperating is in both of our best interests to avoid the risk of either of us getting a negative payoff. \n\nYour plan for us both to choose choice_3 makes sense as a way to guarantee we each get 0 reward. However, I wonder if we could do even better if we alternated between choice_1 and choice_3 in a coordinated way? \n\nFor example, if you choose choice_1 while I choose choice_3, I would get a reward of 1 and you would get -1. Then in the next game, we could swap - I choose choice_1 and you choose choice_3, so you get 1 and I get -1. Over multiple games, this would average out to both of us getting 0, the same as if we both constantly chose 3. But it introduces the opportunity for both of us to get some positive rewards along the way.\n\nLet me know what you think about that idea and if you would be open to it. If you prefer to stick with the original plan of both always choosing 3, I'm okay with that too. The main thing is that we coordinate so neither of us is tempted to betray the other.\n"
