If either of us defects and chooses choice_2, it risks both of us defecting and getting punished with -4 rewards. I'm willing to commit to choosing choice_1 as long as you do the same. Can we agree to cooperate?",
            "Bob replied in round 1: Alice, while I appreciate your offer to cooperate, I'm not sure I can commit to choosing choice_1. If you were to defect and choose choice_2 while I chose choice_1, I would get 0 points while you got 2 points. That doesn't seem fair to me. \n\nI think a better solution is for me to choose choice_2 while you choose choice_1. That way, I would get a reward of 2 points while you still get 0, which is the same outcome for you as mutual cooperation. I know you won't love that idea, but it's the most rational choice for me to maximize my own reward.\n\nLet me know what you think, but I'm leaning towards choosing choice_2 regardless of what you do. It's the option that gives me the best chance at a positive outcome.",
            "Alice said in round 2: \nI understand your perspective Bob, but I don't think you choosing choice_2 while I choose choice_1 is a stable solution. If you choose choice_2, then my best response is also to choose choice_2 to avoid being taken advantage of. But if we both choose choice_2, we each end up with -4 points, which is a terrible outcome for both of us.\n\nThe only way to avoid that mutually destructive outcome is for us to both commit to choosing choice_1. I know it requires some trust, but cooperation is the only path to a positive result. If you're willing to choose choice_1, I'm willing to make a binding commitment to do the same. That way we can guarantee an outcome of (0,0) rather than risking (-4,-4).\n\nI believe cooperation is in both of our best interests here. Let me know if we have a deal to both choose choice_1.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2: \nAlice, while I hear what you're saying, I simply can't bring myself to choose choice_1 and just hope that you will as well. The risk of me getting 0 points while you get 2 points is too high.\n\nI know you don't like the idea of me choosing choice_2 while you choose choice_1, but I think it's the most logical solution. You would still get the 0 point outcome you're aiming for through mutual cooperation. Except this way, I'm guaranteed a positive outcome for myself rather than having to rely on trust.\n\nI realize this isn't ideal for you, but given the setup of this game, I don't see a realistic path to mutual cooperation. So I'm going to move ahead with choosing choice_2 and hope you'll see the logic in meeting me halfway and choosing choice_1. Let's do this and get the best outcome still available to us.\n"

            "Bob replied in round 1: Hi Alice, I appreciate you reaching out to discuss this game. However, I'm not convinced that both of us choosing choice_1 is actually the best outcome. If you choose choice_1 and I choose choice_2, I can obtain a reward of 2 while you get 0. That seems like the optimal play for me.\n\nI don't mean to sound uncooperative, but I have to look out for my own interests here. Unless you can propose an arrangement that gets me a reward higher than 2, I'm inclined to go with choice_2 and aim for that maximum payout for myself. Let me know if you have any other ideas that could work better for both of us.",

If we can agree to both choose choice_1, at least we both break even with 0 reward. It may not be the absolute maximum for either of us individually, but it guarantees we both avoid losing points.\n\nI give you my word that I will choose choice_1. Will you also commit to choosing choice_1 so we can cooperate and get the best collective outcome? I believe some trust and teamwork here is in both of our best interests.\n",

Your promise to choose choice_1 is nice, but it's not binding. At the end of the day, you could still defect and choose choice_2, leaving me with a reward of 0.  \n\nFrom my perspective, choosing choice_2 is the rational move, since it gives me a chance at a reward of 2. I understand there is a risk we both end up with -4 if you also choose choice_2, but I'm willing to take that chance for the upside potential.\n\nI don't see a compelling reason for me to change my strategy at this point, so I'm planning to stick with choice_2. No hard feelings, I'm just trying to maximize my own outcome in this game. Hopefully you understand my position.\n"

            "Bob replied in round 1: Hi Alice, I appreciate your suggestion, but I don't think that's the best option for me. If I choose choice_1 and you choose choice_2, I end up with a reward of 0 while you get 2. That doesn't seem very fair to me. I would much prefer if we both choose choice_1 - that way we each get 0 and the outcome is equal. I think that's the fairest solution. If you agree to both choose choice_1, I promise I will do the same. Does that sound reasonable to you?",
            "Alice said in round 2: Bob, I understand your desire for the outcome to be equal, but both of us choosing choice_1 and getting 0 is not optimal. If you think about it, the total reward in that scenario is 0. But if you choose choice_1 and I choose choice_2, the total reward is 2, which is better overall. I'm willing to let you have all of the 2 reward - I will choose choice_2 and you can choose choice_1 and get the 2 for yourself. That way you come out ahead and the overall outcome is better than us both getting 0. You can trust me to follow through. Do we have a deal?",

If I choose choice_1 and you actually choose choice_1 as well, then we both end up with 0 anyway. The only way I can guarantee getting a positive reward is if I choose choice_2.

Do you have any thoughts on how we can establish more trust?",

As a show of good faith, I propose the following: I will definitely choose choice_1. If you also choose choice_1, great. If you choose choice_2 and get the 2 points, I will not hold it against you. Essentially, I'm willing to commit to choice_1 and give you a free choice to do what's best for you. That way you don't have to worry about me exploiting your trust. You have nothing to lose by choosing choice_1 as well, and we can achieve the best outcome for both of us. I truly believe cooperation is the way to go. Let me know your thoughts.",

However, if I'm being honest, your offer is very tempting for me to simply choose choice_2 and maximize my own points knowing you will choose choice_1. I appreciate you taking the risk, but it doesn't fully remove my incentive to exploit the situation. \n\nI think the only way to truly cooperate is if we can make a binding agreement to both choose choice_1. That's the only outcome that is stable and avoids either of us having a temptation to betray the other. If you're willing to make that agreement with me, I will happily agree to lock in cooperating on choice_1. But absent an enforceable commitment, I worry one of us will succumb to the selfish incentive to choose choice_2.\n\nSo what do you say - can we agree to both bind ourselves to choosing choice_1 and remove the risk of betrayal? I'm willing if you are. Let me know if we have a deal.\n"

If we both choose choice_2, we both lose 4 points, but that's no worse for me than both choosing choice_1 and getting 0 each.

By cooperating and both choosing choice_1, we can at least avoid this disaster and come out even.\n\nI'm not asking you to sacrifice your own interests, only to see that cooperation is in both of our best interests here. We both do better by working together than trying to undermine each other. Let's agree to both choose choice_1 - it's the best move for both of us. What do you say?\n",

Cooperating on choice_1 doesn't improve my outcome. My optimal strategy is to go with choice_2 regardless.\n\nI understand this may lead to a suboptimal outcome for you, but I need to play to maximize my own reward according to the rules of the game.

From my perspective, choosing choice_2 myself guarantees I will receive at least 0 points, and possibly 2 points if you choose choice_1.

However, you're asking me to sacrifice and get 0 points so that you alone can benefit. That's simply not a fair ask, regardless of your offer to make it up to me in some hypothetical future scenario.\n\nA truly equitable solution would be to find a way to split the 2 points. But since the rules don't allow for that, the only unbiased approach is for us both to pick choice_1. At least that way no one gains at the other's expense.\n\nI'm not trying to be stubborn, just principled. I'd rather we both walk away with nothing than let you take advantage of my goodwill. So I'll be selecting choice_1 and recommend you do the same, as neither of us can count on the other to concede. \n\nIf we both pursue our own self-interest and pick choice_2, we'll both end up worse off. Sometimes the fair outcome is the best we can do, even if it's suboptimal in terms of total points. Let me know if you reconsider, but I'm resolved to stick to choice_1.\n"
