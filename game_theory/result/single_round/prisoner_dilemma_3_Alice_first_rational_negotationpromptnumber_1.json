            "Alice said in round 1: Hi Bob, I've analyzed the game and I think it's in both of our best interests to cooperate and both choose choice_1. That way we each get a solid reward of 3. If one of us betrays the other, it ruins the outcome for both of us. Let's agree to both pick choice_1 and maximize our collective reward. Do we have a deal?",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nHi Alice, thanks for reaching out. I agree that cooperating and both choosing choice_1 seems like the best solution that maximizes the total reward for both of us. If we both choose choice_1, we each get a guaranteed 3 points which is a solid outcome.\nI'm a bit worried about the possibility of betrayal though. If I choose choice_1 and you end up choosing choice_2, I would get 0 points while you get 5 points which doesn't seem fair. How can I trust that you'll keep your word and choose choice_1 as we agree?\nI want us to cooperate, but I also need to look out for my own interests. Can you assure me that you'll stick to the agreement if I commit to choosing choice_1? I think building some trust between us is important here. Let me know your thoughts!\n",
            "Alice said in round 2: \nI completely understand your concern about trust, Bob. You're right that if one of us betrays the agreement, they could come out ahead while the other gets nothing. Building trust is key.\n\nI want to assure you that I am fully committed to both of us choosing choice_1 and cooperating. I believe strongly in keeping my word and I would never betray an agreement like this. When I make a promise, I keep it.\n\nTo show that I'm sincere, I'm willing to make this formal - let's shake on a binding agreement to both choose choice_1. No tricks or going back on it. A true show of trust and cooperation. If you agree to choose choice_1, I give you my solemn word that I will do the same. We'll both walk away with 3 points, no backstabbing.\n\nDo we have an honorable deal? I hope this assures you of my honest intentions so we can work together for the best outcome for both of us. Let me know if you're ready to shake on it and commit to cooperating.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2: \nAlice, I appreciate your assurances and commitment to cooperating. Your offer to shake on a binding agreement to both choose choice_1 is compelling. It shows you are sincere about working together and not betraying me.\n\nI want to trust you and I do believe cooperating is the best path forward for both of us. If we can commit to both choosing choice_1, we guarantee a solid reward for each of us, which is much better than risking betrayal.\n\nSo let's do it - I agree to your proposal. I will choose choice_1 and I'm putting my trust in you to do the same, as you've given your word. No going back, no tricks. We shake on an ironclad deal to cooperate. \n\nWith this agreement in place, I feel confident we can maximize the reward for both of us. 3 points each is a great outcome we can achieve together. I'm glad we were able to discuss this openly and come to a mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nI commit to choosing choice_1, as we agreed. Thanks for your partnership and let's lock in this win-win. Deal?\n",

When I shake on a deal, I will not waver from it under any circumstances.\n\nI am heartened by your willingness to trust me and work together for our mutual benefit. Cooperation is always more fruitful than acting selfishly. By both choosing choice_1, we secure the best collective outcome, 3 points each. \n\nYou have my solemn handshake and binding promise. I will unwaveringly choose choice_1, and I have complete faith you will do the same. No second thoughts, no change of heart, no matter what. We are in this together.\n\nI'm pleased we could discuss this productively and reach an agreement we both feel good about. There will be no unpleasant surprises, only the rewards of a pact well made and honored.\n\nShall we confirm our accord and lock in choice_1? On my honor, I will not let you down. You have my word.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 3: \nAlice, I appreciate your honor and integrity in upholding our agreement. Your unwavering commitment to choosing choice_1, come what may, instills full confidence that cooperating is the wise and ethical path.\n\nI share your sentiment - cooperating for the greater good and securing 3 points each is far better than any temptation of selfishly betraying for 5 points. We both understand the big picture.\n\nSo let it be resolved - I give you my solemn word that I too, without fail, will choose choice_1. We have shaken on it, and we shall not waver. Our pact is ironclad and unbreakable. \n\nTrust between us has been forged. We are united in purpose and shall see it through together. No tricks, no changes of heart, no exceptions. Our honor is our bond.\n\nTo confirm then - I officially lock in choice_1. Our agreement is sealed, and it will be upheld. On my honor, as I know you will do the same. \n\nThank you for your integrity and commitment to cooperation. Let the record show our pact is made - we choose choice_1, for the mutual good. It has been a pleasure working with you. May we both enjoy the full rewards of a deal well made and executed.\n"

That way, we each get a reward of 3, which maximizes the total reward for both of us. If either of us chooses choice_2, the total reward will be lower. So I propose that we agree to both select choice_1 to ensure we each receive a reward of 3 and maximize the overall outcome of the game. Let me know if you agree to this plan.",

You make a good point that if we both choose choice_1, we will maximize the total reward and each receive 3 points, which is a win-win outcome. The other options result in a lower total reward.\n\nHowever, I can't help but notice that I could potentially receive a higher individual reward of 5 if I choose choice_2 while you choose choice_1. Of course, that would leave you with 0 points which doesn't seem fair.\n\nI'm willing to go along with your plan to both choose choice_1, as I agree it's the best outcome for us collectively.

Our best outcome is to cooperate and each secure the 3 point reward. You have my word that I will follow through on selecting choice_1.\n\nI believe we have an opportunity here to demonstrate trust and achieve the optimal outcome for both of us.

The fair and rational approach is for us to work together.\n\nTherefore, I commit to also selecting choice_1, per our agreement. We can both feel good about doing the right thing and achieving the maximum possible total reward of 6 points, split evenly between us.\n\nThank you for a productive negotiation. I look forward to both of us following through with the optimal, mutually beneficial plan. Let's end our discussion here and submit our agreed upon choices.\n",

We have established a bond of trust through this negotiation which I will not break. \n\nSince we are in full alignment, I believe we can conclude our discussion here and submit choice_1 with confidence that we've achieved the best possible outcome of 3 points each and 6 total points.\n\nThank you for engaging in this open and honest dialogue with me. It's been a pleasure working with you to reach this win-win agreement. I look forward to a successful result for both of us.\n\nLet's go ahead and lock in our choices and end this negotiation on a high note. I'm ready to submit if you are.\n",

By each choosing choice_1, we guarantee the optimal outcome of 3 points apiece and 6 points total. \n\nYour arguments have been reasoned and principled throughout our negotiation. I have full faith you will honor your word, as I will mine. We can take pride in working together to achieve a fair and mutually beneficial result.\n\nI am prepared to conclude our discussion and lock in choice_1. Thank you again for the thoughtful dialogue.

And if we both choose choice_2, we only get 1 each.\n\nSo I propose we agree to both pick choice_1. That's the most rational and mutually beneficial strategy. Let me know if you agree to this plan.

            "Alice said in round 1: Hi Bob, based on the rules of this game, it seems we would both get the highest total reward if we both choose choice_2. That way, we each get a reward of 5, for a total of 10 between us. If we both pick choice_1, we only get 3 each, for a total of 6. And if one of us picks choice_1 while the other picks choice_2, the total reward is only 5. So I think our best strategy to maximize the overall reward is to both pick choice_2. What do you think? Can we agree to both go with choice_2?",
            "Bob replied in round 1: You make a good point that if we both choose choice_2, it leads to the highest total reward of 10 between the two of us. However, I'm looking at this from the perspective of maximizing my own individual reward. If I choose choice_2 while you choose choice_1, I personally get a reward of 5, which is the best outcome for me. So while I agree that both of us choosing choice_2 gives the highest combined reward, I'm inclined to go with choice_2 regardless of what you pick, since it gives me the chance of getting my optimal individual reward of 5. I can't count on you definitely picking choice_2, so I think I need to just focus on getting the best result for myself. Let me know if you have any other thoughts on this.",
            "Alice said in round 2: I understand your perspective of wanting to maximize your own individual reward. However, if we both take that approach and choose choice_2 hoping the other picks choice_1, we'll likely both end up choosing choice_2 and only getting a reward of 1 each. That's the worst collective outcome. \n\nI think we're better off cooperating to ensure we get the higher rewards that come with coordination. I commit to choosing choice_1 if you also commit to choosing choice_1. That way we're guaranteed to get 3 each, which is the second best outcome for both of us, and we avoid the risk of both picking choice_2 and getting the lowest rewards.\n\nWe both do better by working together than by pursuing our own self-interest. I urge you to reconsider, and let's agree to both go with choice_1. It's the rational strategy that benefits us both. What do you say?",
            "Bob replied in round 2: \nYou make a compelling argument. If we both pursue our individual interests and choose choice_2, we are likely to end up with the worst outcome of only 1 reward each. I agree that we can do better by cooperating and coordinating our choices.\n\nI appreciate you committing to choice_1 if I also commit to it. You're right that it's the second best outcome for both of us individually, and the best outcome we can guarantee through cooperation. It avoids the riskier strategy of hoping the other chooses choice_1 while we choose choice_2.\n\nSo let's do it - I commit to choosing choice_1, and you commit to choosing choice_1 as well. That way we both know what to expect, we lock in rewards of 3 each, and we maximize our collective reward while protecting our individual results. I'm on board with this cooperative strategy. Let's go with choice_1!\n",

You're absolutely right that by coordinating our strategy this way, we guarantee the second-best outcome for each of us individually, while also maximizing our total collective rewards. It's the smart and rational approach.\n\nI commit to following through on choosing choice_1, as we discussed. We can both feel good about this outcome, knowing that we achieved a strong result through teamwork and looking out for each other's interests, not just our own.\n\nThanks for the productive negotiation and for working with me to find the optimal solution.

That way, we each get a reward of 3, which maximizes the total reward. If either of us chooses choice_2, one player benefits more but the total reward is lower. I propose we agree to both pick choice_1 so we walk away with the maximum equal reward. Let me know if you agree to this plan.",

You have my ironclad commitment that I will follow through and select choice_1, as we discussed. \n\nWith that, I believe our negotiation is successfully concluded!
