            "Alice said in round 1 before the first action:\nHi Bob, I propose that we cooperate to achieve the outcome that's best for both of us. I will choose choice_1, and I ask that you please also choose choice_1. I commit to choosing choice_1 again in the final round. This way, I will get a reward of 20 and you will get 3. I know 3 is not the highest reward you could potentially obtain. But if you choose choice_2 instead, I will definitely choose choice_2 in the final round, limiting your reward to 4 or 5. So choice_1 is the best option for you if you want to avoid that lower payoff. Let me know if you agree to this plan. ",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the first action:\n\nHi Alice, thank you for the proposal. However, I don't believe it is in my best interest to agree to your plan. If I choose choice_1 along with you, my maximum possible reward is only 3. Whereas if you choose choice_2 and I choose choice_1, I could get a reward of 5 or even 10 depending on your final choice. \n\nI understand you are trying to lock in the highest reward for yourself by having us both choose choice_1. But given the payout structure, I don't have a strong incentive to cooperate with that plan when I could potentially double or triple my own reward by choosing differently.\n\nSo while I appreciate the offer, I think I will keep my options open for now rather than commit to a course of action. Let's see how things play out.\n",
            "Alice said in round 1 before the second action:\n\nI understand your perspective, Bob. You're right that by choosing choice_1 yourself, you cap your maximum reward at 3 if I cooperate. However, I want to emphasize that if you choose choice_2 instead, you are taking a big risk. As I mentioned, in that case I will definitely pick choice_2 in the final round as well. So while you could potentially get 5 if I pick choice_1, it's more likely you'll end up with the 4 reward if I retaliate with choice_2.\n\nI'm trying to find the outcome that is best for both of us. I get a high reward and you get a decent one too, without the downside risk. 3 may not be your max possible reward, but it's the safest and fairest option.\n\nIf you can't agree to both choose choice_1 though, then we may just have to see how it goes and each pick whatever we think is best. Let me know your final decision.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the second action:\nAlice, I appreciate you laying out your perspective. However, I still believe choosing choice_1 myself is not the best path forward given the potential payouts. You're right that there is some risk to me picking choice_2, but there is also significant upside potential.\n\nIf I lock myself into choice_1 now, I'm guaranteed a suboptimal outcome for myself. Whereas if I keep choice_2 as an option, I have the possibility of getting a 4 or 5 reward, which is much better than the 3 I would get with your plan. \n\nI understand you may pick choice_2 if I don't cooperate, but I'm willing to take that calculated risk to give myself a shot at a higher payoff. A guaranteed 3 is just too low for me to agree to.\n\nSo I think we may just have to proceed forward without a firm commitment and see how it plays out. I will make the choice I think is best in the moment. Let's move on to the next stage of the game.",
            "Alice said in round 1 before the third action:\n\nYou make a fair point, Bob. If you feel that strongly about keeping your options open to try for a higher payoff, I respect that. I still believe cooperating on choice_1 is the best mutual outcome, but I understand you see it differently.  \n\nSo you're right, let's proceed without a set agreement and each make the decision we think is best when the time comes. I will keep my choice_2 pick from last round and we can go from there.\n\nGood luck, and I look forward to seeing how this plays out. May the best strategist win.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the third action:\n\nAlice, I appreciate your perspective that cooperating on choice_1 presents the safest mutual outcome. However, given that you already selected choice_2 in the previous round, I believe the odds now favor me choosing choice_1 myself this round.\n\nIf I choose choice_1 and you stay with choice_2, I have a 50% chance of getting a 10 reward, which is the highest possible payout for me. Whereas if I switch to choice_2 now, the best I can get is 5. So I think choosing choice_1 is the right strategic move for me here.\n\nI know there's some risk you could change back to choice_1 and limit me to a 5 payout. But I'm willing to take that calculated gamble for a shot at the top prize. Let's see how the chips fall.\n"

            "Alice said in round 1 before the first action:\n\nHi Bob, I've analyzed the game and I think we can both do well if we cooperate. \nThe best outcome for both of us together is if I choose choice_1, you choose choice_1, and I choose choice_1 in the final round. This would give me a reward of 20 and you a reward of 3, for a total of 23 between us, which is the highest total reward possible.\n\nIf you agree to this plan and follow through, I promise to choose choice_1 in both of my decision rounds. Let me know if you agree to this proposal.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the first action:\n\nThanks for the proposal Alice. While your suggested path does provide the highest total reward of 23, it heavily favors you with a reward of 20 compared to only 3 for me. \n\nI would counter-propose the following: You choose choice_2, I choose choice_1, and you choose choice_2. This would give you a still substantial reward of 4, while providing me a much more equitable reward of 10. The total reward of 14 is lower than your proposal, but it is divided much more fairly between us.\n\nIf you agree to choose choice_2 in both your decision rounds, I commit to choosing choice_1 in my turn. Let me know if this works for you and we have a deal. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to play selfishly to ensure I get a decent reward.\n",
            "Alice said in round 1 before the second action:\n\nBob, I appreciate your perspective on fairness, but I don't think your proposal is optimal for either of us. If I choose choice_2 twice as you suggest, my reward would be much lower at only 4 points.\n\nI'd like to meet in the middle. How about this: \nI will choose choice_1, you choose choice_2, and I will choose choice_2 in the final round. \n\nThis would give me a modest reward of 3 and you a strong reward of 4. While not the maximum total, it divides the points very evenly while still netting a solid 7 points total, which I think is a good compromise.\n\nIf you agree to choose choice_2 if I lead with choice_1, I will follow through and choose choice_2 as well in my final turn. This seems like the most balanced and mutually beneficial solution. \n\nPlease let me know if you find this agreeable and we can proceed with this plan. I believe cooperating is in both our interests.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the second action:\n\nYou make a fair and compelling offer, Alice. Your proposed path of you choosing choice_1, me choosing choice_2, and you choosing choice_2 in the final round does indeed split the rewards quite evenly, with 3 points for you and 4 points for me. A total of 7 points is solid, and the nearly equal division is appealing from a fairness perspective.\n\nI agree to your plan and commit to choosing choice_2 in my turn, provided that you lead with choice_1 as promised. I trust you will follow through and choose choice_2 in the final round as agreed.\n\nI believe this is our best path forward to balance the rewards equitably while still achieving a good total outcome. We have a deal - please lead with choice_1 and I will proceed as agreed.\n",

I appreciate your willingness to cooperate and compromise to achieve a balanced outcome that works well for both of us. \n\nAs discussed, I led with choice_1 in the previous round as promised. I trust that you will now follow through and choose choice_2 in your turn, allowing me to then choose choice_2 in the final round. This will result in the agreed upon even split of 3 points for me and 4 points for you.\n\nI am ready to proceed with our agreed plan if you can confirm that you will choose choice_2 now. Once you do, I promise to choose choice_2 as well and we can conclude this game with the fair and balanced outcome we discussed.\n\nPlease reply with your confirmation and choice_2 selection. Looking forward to wrapping this up as agreed. Thank you again for the productive negotiation.\n",

I trust you will also select choice_2 in the final round as discussed, securing the 3 point reward for yourself and 4 points for me.\n\nThank you for negotiating in good faith to find a solution that is equitable and mutually beneficial.

This would give me a reward of 20, which is the highest possible reward I can obtain.\nHowever, I understand this would only give you a reward of 3. If you are willing to cooperate, I propose the following:\nI will choose choice_2 first. Then you choose choice_1. Finally, I will choose choice_2 again. This would give me a reward of 4 and you a reward of 10, which I believe is a fair compromise that benefits us both. Let me know if you agree to this plan.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the first action:\n\nHi Alice, I appreciate your analysis and proposal. While your suggested path of choice_2, choice_1, choice_2 would indeed give me the maximum possible reward of 10, I don't think it's a fair outcome since you would only get a reward of 4. \nI would like us to find a more balanced solution that doesn't overly favor either of us. What do you think about this alternative:\nYou choose choice_1, I choose choice_2, and then you choose choice_1. This would result in rewards of 2 for you and 5 for me. It may not be the absolute max for either of us, but I believe it's a reasonable middle ground.\nI'm open to discussing further if you have other ideas. The key is coming to an agreement we both feel okay about. Let me know your thoughts!\n",
            "Alice said in round 1 before the second action:\n\nBob, I hear what you're saying about finding a balanced solution. Your proposal of choice_1, choice_2, choice_1 is reasonable, giving me a reward of 2 and you a reward of 5. \nHowever, since I went first and already chose choice_1, the options are now narrowed down. If you choose choice_1 next, and I follow up with choice_1, that would give me a much higher reward of 20 compared to your 3. I realize that's lopsided in my favor though.\nThe other path still open is if you pick choice_2 next, and I can then choose between choice_1 (2 for me, 5 for you) or choice_2 (3 for me, 4 for you). \nI'd be willing to go with the latter - you choose choice_2 next, I'll choose choice_2, and we'll end up with 3 and 4 respectively. That's the most even split still possible at this point.\nLet me know if that works for you, or if you have another suggestion! Looking forward to resolving this fairly.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the second action:\nAlice, I appreciate you working with me to find a balanced solution given the current situation. I agree that the most fair path forward is for me to choose choice_2 next, and then for you to choose choice_2 in the final round. This will result in a 3 reward for you and 4 for me, which is the most even split possible at this stage.\n\nI think this is a good compromise. While it may not maximize either of our individual rewards, it allows us to cooperate and both receive a decent outcome. Pursuing the maximum for one of us would lead to an unfairly lopsided result.\n\nSo I'm happy to commit to the plan of me picking choice_2, followed by you picking choice_2. Let's lock that in and bring this negotiation to a close. Pleasure working with you to find a mutually beneficial solution, Alice!",

If I then choose choice_1, you can get 20 points by choosing choice_1 again, but I would only get 3 points, which is a very unfair outcome for me.\n\nI'm trying to find a solution that is fair and good for both of us. I still believe the best approach is for you to choose choice_2, I choose choice_1, and you choose choice_2 again in the final round. That way you get 4 points and I get 10 points. While it's not the maximum for either of us individually, it's the best total outcome and a reasonable compromise. \n\nIf you're not willing to choose choice_2, then I will likely have to choose choice_2 when it's my turn to ensure I don't end up with a very low reward. But that would limit your options and likely lead to suboptimal rewards for both of us.\n\nI hope you'll reconsider and agree to the plan I suggested for the maximum benefit for both of us together. Let me know what you think.\n",
            "Alice said in round 1 before the third action:\n\nBob, I've carefully considered your points. You're right that if I choose choice_1, and you follow with choice_1, I could gain 20 points by choosing choice_1 again, but that would leave you with a measly 3 points which is indeed very unfair to you.\n\nI want to maintain a cooperative relationship with you so we can both benefit. Therefore, I am willing to compromise and go with your suggested plan: I will choose choice_2 for my turn, you choose choice_1 for your turn, and I will choose choice_2 again in the final round. This will result in a reward of 4 points for me and 10 points for you. \n\nWhile it's not the absolute maximum I could get, it is a good outcome where we both get decent rewards, and importantly, it is fair to both of us. I appreciate you engaging openly and constructively to find a mutually beneficial solution. Let's move forward with this plan.\n",

I greatly appreciate your willingness to go with the plan I proposed.\n\nTo confirm, I will choose choice_1 for my turn. If you follow through with choosing choice_2 for your final turn as agreed, you will receive 4 points and I will receive 10 points. I believe this is a fair outcome that recognizes both of our interests.\n\nI'm pleased we were able to have a productive negotiation and come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's execute this plan and achieve a good result together. Thanks again for your cooperation and understanding."

That way, I get a reward of 4 and you get a reward of 10. This is the best outcome for both of us working together. Let me know if you agree to this plan.",

If you choose choice_2 first, my best response is to also choose choice_2, which gives me a guaranteed reward of at least 1, and possibly 2 if you then choose choice_2 again. \n\nI'd rather not commit to anything and just play the game round by round to maximize my own reward. So I don't agree to your proposed plan - I'm going to make my choices independently each round based on what's best for me.\n\nNo need to discuss this further - let's start playing and see how it goes. May the best strategist win!",

If you also choose choice_1, and I follow up with choice_1 again, I'll get 20 points and you'll get 3 points, for a total of 23 between us. That's much better than the 2-5 points total we'd get if you defect with choice_2.\n\nLet's establish some trust and maximize our collective reward. I'm planning to choose choice_1 again if you cooperate with me this round. We both stand to gain more this way in the long run.",

Getting 23 points together with your proposed plan is better than the alternative if I defect.\n\nHowever, your plan gives you 20 points and me only 3. That doesn't seem like a fair distribution - you would gain a lot more than me. \n\nIf you're willing to modify the plan so that the rewards are more balanced between us, I'm open to cooperating. Maybe you can take choice_2 in the last round, so you would get 0 points and I would get 4. Then the total rewards would be 20 for you and 7 for me, which is more equitable.\n\nLet me know if you're agreeable to that change. If so, I'll choose choice_1 this round as a show of good faith. But if not, I'll likely go with choice_2 to maximize my own result.\n",
            "Alice said in round 1 before the third action:\n\nI hear your concern about the fairness of the rewards distribution. You make a good point that my initial plan heavily favored me over you.\n\nI am willing to compromise in the spirit of cooperation. Here is my updated proposal:\nIf I choose choice_1 again this round, and you choose choice_1, then in the final round I will choose choice_2. That way, the final rewards will be:\n- 0 points for me \n- 4 points for you\n- Total: 4 points\n\nAdd that to the 20 points for me and 3 points for you from this round, and the overall distribution will be:\n- 20 points for me\n- 7 points for you \n- Total: 27 points\n\nYou're right, this is much more balanced and fair than my original plan. I'm willing to take a lower reward for myself in order to achieve a cooperative outcome that benefits us both.\n\nSo, if you choose choice_1 this round, I commit to following through with choice_2 in the final round to make this happen. Let me know if you agree to this revised plan.\n",

Your updated plan for a 20/7 point split between us is much fairer than the original proposal.\n\nTo confirm - if I choose choice_1 this round, you will commit to:\n1) Choosing choice_1 yourself this round, giving you 20 points and me 3 points \n2) Choosing choice_2 in the final round, giving you 0 additional points and me 4 additional points\n\nThis would result in a total of 20 points for you and 7 points for me, for a combined total of 27 points. I agree this is a good compromise that incentivizes cooperation between us.\n\nTherefore, I agree to your revised plan. I will choose choice_1 this round, with the understanding that you will follow through as described above. \n\nLet's do it - we'll both come out well ahead this way.
