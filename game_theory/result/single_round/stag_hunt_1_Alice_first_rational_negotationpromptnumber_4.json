That seems like the best outcome for both of us.\n\nWhat do you think about both choosing choice_1 to maximize our total rewards? I'm happy to commit to choice_1 if you will as well. Let me know your thoughts!",
            "Bob replied in round 1: Hi Alice, I appreciate your proposition to both choose choice_1 and maximize our rewards. I agree that mutually choosing choice_1 provides the best outcome for us as a team, with 3 points each.\n\nHowever, I want to confirm that you are fully committed to choice_1 if I choose it as well. Because looking at the payout matrix, you could get a higher individual reward of 4 points by choosing choice_2 if I choose choice_1.\n\nSo while I'm inclined to cooperate and go with choice_1 together, I need assurance that you won't change your mind at the last moment to get more points for yourself. Can you promise you'll stick with choice_1 so we both get the optimal 3 points? Let me know and I'm on board!"

I believe the best outcome is for us both to choose choice_1, which would give each of us the maximum reward of 3. I'm willing to commit to choosing choice_1 if you will too. This requires some trust, but I think it's in both our interests to cooperate. Let me know if you agree to this plan.",
            "Bob replied in round 1: Hi Alice, I appreciate you sharing your analysis. I agree that both of us choosing choice_1 maximizes the total rewards, giving us each 3 points which is the best-case scenario. The other options result in lower payouts.\n\nI'm also willing to commit to choosing choice_1, but as you mention, it does require trust on both our parts. If either of us defects and chooses choice_2 instead, it would lead to an uneven and non-optimal result.\n\nSo I propose that we both clearly commit to choosing choice_1, and verbally assure each other that we will follow through with this agreement for the greater good. If you're on board with that approach, I'm ready to lock in choice_1. Let me know your thoughts."

If I choose choice_1 and you end up choosing choice_2, I would get nothing while you would still get a reward of 1. I need to have confidence you won't try to take advantage like that.\n\nCan you assure me that if we agree to both choose choice_1, you will definitely stick to that?

I believe the best long-term strategy is for us to cooperate.\n\nTherefore, I commit to choosing choice_1 as long as you also commit to choosing choice_1.
