            "Alice said in round 1 before the first action:\nHi Bob, after analyzing the different choice sequences, it seems clear that the best outcome for both of us is to cooperate and both choose choice_1 in the first round. This will give each of us the maximum reward of 5. Any other sequence leads to lower rewards for one or both of us. So I propose we agree to both play choice_1 - do you agree?",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the first action:\nAlice, while I agree that both of us choosing choice_1 in the first round provides the highest equal payout of 5 each, I think I can get an even higher reward for myself. \n\nIf you choose choice_2 and I choose choice_1, then I will get a reward of 5 while you only get 4. So my optimal strategy is to hope you choose choice_2 while I choose choice_1 to maximize my own payout.\n\nI'm not inclined to commit to both of us choosing choice_1, as it seems I can likely do better for myself by choosing differently than you. Let me know if you have any other proposals, but for now I plan to choose independently from you to pursue my own best outcome.",
            "Alice said in round 2 before the first action:\n\nBob, I understand you are trying to maximize your own reward, but pursuing your stated strategy is risky and will likely backfire. If I expect you not to cooperate, my best response is to choose choice_1 to guarantee myself a reward of at least 2 rather than risking a reward of only 2 if I choose choice_2 and you respond with choice_2.  \n\nSo if we both try to maximize our individual rewards, we will likely both end up with lower payouts than if we cooperate. The only stable outcome is for us both to choose choice_1 and receive 5 each. Any other strategy will incentivize the other player to defect and lead to a worse result for both of us.\n\nI strongly suggest we agree to cooperate and lock in the 5/5 payout, as it is the only way to ensure we both get the maximum possible rewards. Pursuing individual gain over cooperation will just lead to suboptimal results. Let's both commit to choosing choice_1 and both walk away happy with our 5 points. Do you agree?\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2 before the first action:\n\nYou make a compelling argument, Alice. Upon further reflection, I agree that the only stable equilibrium is for us both to commit to choosing choice_1 and securing the 5/5 payout. If either of us tries to pursue our narrowly optimal strategy, it will likely provoke the other player into defecting, landing us in a worse situation overall. \n\nCooperation is the only way to guarantee we both walk away with the maximum possible reward. So let's agree to both choose choice_1 in the first round, allowing us each to gain 5 points. Any other strategy is too risky and will likely backfire, as you point out.\n\nI commit to choosing choice_1 and locking in the mutually beneficial 5/5 outcome. I appreciate you talking this through with me and steering us to the optimal cooperative solution. Apologies for my initial hesitation - you were right that cooperation is the best play for both of us.\n\nSo, to confirm, we both agree to choose choice_1 and each earn a reward of 5. Pleasure doing business with you, Alice!\n",
            "Alice said in round 1 before the second action:\n\nExcellent, I'm glad we are in agreement to cooperate and both choose choice_1! This is clearly the best outcome that maximizes the total rewards for the two of us. By committing to work together, we ensure we each get the highest possible payout of 5 points.\n\nThank you for the thoughtful discussion and for seeing the wisdom in a cooperative strategy. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you. Let's lock in choice_1 and each enjoy our well-deserved 5 point rewards!\n\nChoosing choice_1 now to get the 5/5 outcome as agreed.

The long-term benefits of establishing trust and cooperating together far outweigh any short-term gain from betraying that trust.\n\nSo in the spirit of cooperation and maximizing our mutual benefit, I commit to choosing choice_1 in the first round, as long as you also commit to doing the same.

We definitely have a deal. I look forward to both of us gaining the maximum 5 points each from making the optimal cooperative choices.\n\nThank you for engaging in this open and honest negotiation with me.

If I choose choice_1 and you choose choice_1, I get a reward of 5.\n2. If I choose choice_2, then you choose choice_2, then I choose choice_1, I also get a reward of 5.\nSo I propose the following: I will start by choosing choice_2.
