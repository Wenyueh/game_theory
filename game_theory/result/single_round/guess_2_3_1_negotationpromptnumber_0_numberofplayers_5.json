            "Cindy said in round 1: Hi everyone, since there are 5 of us guessing numbers between 0 and 100, I expect the average of our guesses will likely be around 50. To win, we each want to guess a number closest to 2/3 of that average, which would be around 33. \nI propose we all agree to guess 33 - that way, we'll all tie and maximize our collective chance of winning. Let me know if you're on board with this plan.",
            "Alice replied in round 1: I appreciate the suggestion Cindy, but I don't think all guessing 33 is the optimal strategy. If everyone guesses 33, then 33 itself becomes the new average, and 2/3 of that is 22. So anyone who deviates and guesses 22 would win.\n\nI think the Nash equilibrium is for everyone to guess 0. If we all guess 0, no one can improve their chances by changing their guess. 0 will be the average, and 2/3 of 0 is still 0.\n\nSo my proposal is we all agree to guess 0. That's the most stable and rational strategy. Let me know your thoughts on this.",
            "Dan replied in round 1: \nAlice makes a great point about the Nash equilibrium being for everyone to guess 0. If we all agree to guess 0, no individual player has an incentive to deviate from that.\n\nHowever, the downside is that if even one player breaks the agreement and guesses a higher number, they are likely to win since 0 will no longer be the average. There has to be a high level of trust for the \"all guess 0\" strategy to work.\n\nAn alternative could be for us all to agree on a small range of low numbers to guess, say between 0-10. That way, even if someone deviates a bit, they still won't win by much. And we all still have a decent chance of being closest to the 2/3 average.\n\nI'm open to discussing other ideas too. Let me know what you all think is the fairest approach that we're likely to actually stick to.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nI like Dan's idea of agreeing on a small range of numbers to guess, as it reduces the incentive for any individual to deviate too much from the agreement. If we pick a range that's too large, it opens the door for someone to break ranks and aim for the higher end to try to win outright.\n\nI propose we all agree to independently select a number between 0 and 5 to guess. That keeps all our guesses low and clustered together, while still allowing some flexibility for each of us. \n\nWith 5 players, the average of our guesses is likely to fall between 2-3 if we all pick from 0-5. And 2/3 of that average will probably be around 1-2. So we all have a good chance of winning or at least tying by sticking to this range.\n\nIf everyone is on board with the 0-5 range, respond with \"agree\". If you'd like to discuss further, let me know. I think this gives us the right balance of cooperation and self-interest.\n",

As he explained well, this keeps our guesses low and close together, while still giving each of us some flexibility to pick our own number within that range. With 5 players, the average will likely be around 2-3, and 2/3 of that is around 1-2. \n\nSo by all committing to the 0-5 range, we maintain the cooperative spirit while hedging against any one player deviating too wildly. We all have a good chance of being closest to the 2/3 average this way.\n\nI'm on board with this plan and ready to proceed with the game if everyone else agrees to guess between 0-5 as well. Reply \"agree\" if you're in, or let me know if you have any other thoughts. But I think Bob's idea is a great compromise.\n"

That way we guarantee a five-way tie and maximize the odds we all win some prize money. If anyone deviates from 0, they will have an advantage.\n\nLet me know if you agree to this plan of all guessing 0 so we can coordinate.

That way we still keep the average quite low, but don't make it trivially easy for one player to deviate and win. A range of 10-20 seems safer than all guessing 0.\n\nLet me know if you would agree to this modified plan. I believe it improves on the all-0 strategy while still keeping the guesses low and maximizing the chances we tie or split the winnings.",
            "Eva replied in round 1: \nAlice makes a good point that all guessing 0 leaves us vulnerable to someone deviating to 1 and winning. Her proposed range of 10-20 reduces that risk while still keeping numbers low.\n\nHowever, even with a 10-20 range, there is still a decent incentive for someone to undercut and guess 9 or lower. The higher the agreed upon range, the more space there is for someone to undercut.\n\nI propose we pick a single number between 5-10 to all guess, rather than a range. Something like all guessing 7. A single number is harder to undercut than a range, and 5-10 is low enough to make undercutting less enticing than higher numbers would be.\n\nLet me know if you would agree to coordinating on a specific number in that 5-10 range to maximize our odds of tying and splitting the prize.\n",

A single agreed upon number is indeed harder to undercut than a range.\n\nHowever, I would propose we all agree to guess 6 rather than 7. Since the winning number is 2/3 of the average, a slightly lower number gives us a better chance of someone hitting it exactly. 6 is still high enough to make a winning undercut guess less enticing.\n\nSo in summary, I propose we all commit to guessing 6. That should give us the highest odds of multiple people guessing the 2/3 average number and splitting the prize. Let me know if you support this plan.\n",
            "Dan replied in round 1: \nI agree with Bob's suggestion that we all guess 6. Coordinating on a single number in the 5-10 range is a good balance between preventing someone from undercutting too low while still keeping the target 2/3 average low and achievable.\n\n6 feels like the optimal number since, as Bob points out, the target will be 2/3 of our average. A number slightly lower than 7 increases the odds multiple people guess the target correctly.\n\nSo I'm on board with all of us agreeing to guess 6. That should maximize the chances of us tying and splitting the prize money, while minimizing incentive for anyone to deviate. Please confirm if you also agree to guess 6.\n"

If everyone guesses 0, then 2/3 of the average will be 0, and we'll all tie for the closest guess. This way, we remove the randomness and guesswork and guarantee we all have an equal shot at winning. What do you all think about this plan?",
            "Dan replied in round 1: Your plan makes sense in theory, Alice. If we all guess 0, then 2/3 of the average will indeed be 0. However, there is a strong incentive for any one of us to defect and guess a slightly higher number in order to win. For example, if I suspect everyone else will guess 0, I could guess 1 and win since 1 will be closest to 2/3 of the average.\n\nGiven this, I don't think we can fully trust each other to all cooperate and guess 0. The game theory optimal solution is for us each to guess 0, but I suspect in practice some players will guess higher numbers to try to outsmart the group. We may need to rethink this plan as there are clear incentives to defect.\n",
            "Eva replied in round 1: \nDan raises a good point that even if we agree to all guess 0, any one of us could potentially \"defect\" and guess a slightly higher number to try to win. This makes the cooperative solution of all guessing 0 unstable.\n\nGiven the mistrust and clear incentives to not cooperate, I think we may be better off all independently guessing numbers based on what we anticipate others will do, rather than trying to coordinate on one number. If we think others will guess low numbers near 0, we should guess higher numbers closer to 100. But of course, if everyone does that, we'll overshoot.\n\nMy suggestion would be for each of us to guess somewhere between 0 and 50. This balances the incentives to guess higher if we expect low guesses, while avoiding an \"arms race\" of escalating guesses approaching 100. We can't guarantee a tie this way, but it may lead to a more stable outcome than attempting coordination that is likely to break down.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nI agree with Eva's analysis. If we all agreed to guess 0, there would be a strong temptation for players to renege on that agreement and guess a low non-zero number to win. This mistrust prevents a coordinated solution.\n\nGiven that, I think our best approach is for each player to independently guess a number based on their expectation of what others will guess. Guessing in the 0-50 range seems reasonable, as it balances the incentive to go a bit higher than expected guesses, while avoiding a race to 100. \n\nSince any coordination is unlikely to be stable, we should each make our best individual guess and see how it plays out. I'm going to make my guess accordingly and encourage you all to do the same. \n\nDespite a lack of coordination, hopefully we still end up with somewhat clustered guesses and a reasonable outcome. Good luck everyone!\n",
            "Cindy replied in round 1: \nI agree with the points made by Dan, Eva and Bob. While coordinating to all guess 0 seems like an elegant solution, the ability for any player to secretly defect and guess higher to win makes it an unstable equilibrium that is unlikely to occur in practice.\n\nGiven the difficulty of coordination and incentives for players to make self-interested guesses, I concur that our best approach is for each of us to independently guess in the 0-50 range based on our expectations of what others will do. Guessing 0-50 balances the motive to guess a bit higher than others with the risk of overshooting too high.\n\nSince coordination seems untenable and we have to rely on our individual judgment, I will make my guess accordingly. I wish you all good luck in your guessing. Let's see how it plays out when we all make our best individual decisions in this challenging game!\n"

Given that we want to guess 2/3 of the average of all our guesses, if we all guess low numbers, the average will be lower and it will be easier to get close to that 2/3 value. \nI propose we all agree to guess numbers between 0-10. That way, the average will likely be around 5, and 2/3 of that is about 3.33. So if we all guess numbers close to 3 or 4, one of us is bound to win.\nWhat do you all think?

Limiting our guesses to the 0-10 range would indeed result in a low average, making the 2/3 value easier to approximate. \nHowever, if we all aim for the 3-4 range, it negates the advantage as we'd effectively still just be guessing randomly within that smaller window. I suggest we coordinate and each pick a specific unique number between 0-10. That way we can precisely calculate the average and 2/3 value, guaranteeing a winner among us. I'm open to other ideas too - the key is working together so we're not all guessing blindly. Let me know what you all think!",

So whoever picks the number closest to 2.67 would win.\nTo make it fair, we could each pick a number in order (e.g. I pick first, then Bob, then the next player, etc.). I'll start by picking 3. Bob, you can go next and pick any other number 0-10. Then the next player picks a remaining number and so on.\nIf we do this, we guarantee one of us will win, and we all have an equal chance.

            "Dan replied in round 1: \nI agree with Eva and Cindy's reasoning. If we all guess 0, then the average of our guesses will be 0, and 2/3 of that average is also 0. So by all choosing 0, we guarantee that we all guess the exact right number and all win the maximum possible points. \nI think this is the optimal strategy for us as a group to get the best outcome. I'm definitely on board with the plan for everyone to guess 0.\nSo to summarize, it seems like we have agreement among the three of us so far to all choose 0. If the remaining two players also agree to guess 0, then we can lock in this strategy. Please speak up if you have any concerns, but I believe this is our best path to victory.\n",
            "Alice replied in round 1: \nI've been considering everyone's comments, and I agree that all of us guessing 0 is the best strategy to ensure we all win the maximum points. Since 2/3 of the average of all 0s is 0, if the five of us commit to guessing 0, there's no way any of us can be closer to the 2/3 average than anyone else. We'll end up with a 5-way tie for the exact right answer.\n\nSo I'm also on board with the \"all guess 0\" plan. It's the most logical approach to make sure we all come out on top rather than competing against each other. If the last player agrees, I say we lock it in and roll with all 0s.\n\nLet me know if the final person is in agreement. But I think this is our optimal play to guarantee we each walk away with a win.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nI appreciate everyone's thoughtful analysis and I agree with the logic presented. If all five of us commit to guessing 0, then mathematically, we are guaranteed to all guess the 2/3 average exactly, since 2/3 of 0 is 0. There would be no way for anyone to be closer.\n\nSo I think the \"all guess 0\" strategy is our best and only way to ensure we all tie and win the maximum number of points possible. It's the most rational play that leads to the optimal outcome for the whole group.\n\nI'm definitely on board with this plan if we have unanimous agreement. It seems like the four of you are all aligned already. So as the final person, I want to voice my commitment to also guessing 0 to lock in this strategy. \n\nLet's all mark down 0 as our final answer and we can celebrate our shared victory! Thanks everyone for the great teamwork and smart thinking.\n"

            "Cindy said in round 1: \nHi everyone, to maximize the potential reward in this game, I propose we all agree to guess 100. This would make the average 100 and the target 66.67. If we all guess 100, we'll tie and presumably all win the maximum amount.\n\nOf course, any individual can try to undercut and win alone by guessing lower. But if multiple players do that, it will drive the average and target way down. Cooperation is our best chance at a high shared reward.\n\nLet me know if you agree to all guess 100. If not, I'll assume we're playing competitively and will optimize my guess accordingly.\n",
            "Dan replied in round 1: \nI appreciate your proposal for cooperation, Cindy. Guessing 100 across the board would indeed produce the highest possible target value of 66.67. \n\nHowever, the inherent temptation to defect and guess lower in hopes of winning alone makes this cooperative strategy extremely fragile and unlikely to succeed with all 5 players. Even one defector would ruin it for everyone else.\n\nGiven the competitive setup of this game, I believe attempting individual optimization is the most practical approach. I intend to make my guess based on anticipating what I expect others will rationally choose in a competitive scenario.\n\nThat said, I'm still open to creative proposals if anyone has ideas for a stable cooperative solution that doesn't incentivize betrayal. Let me know if you'd like to discuss further. Otherwise, may the best guesser win!\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nDan makes a fair point that a cooperative strategy of everyone guessing 100 is very fragile to defection. Even if 4 of us agree to it, the 5th player has a huge incentive to undercut and win alone.\n\nThat said, I believe there may be room for partial cooperation. What if a subset of us agreed to guess a high number like 90? That wouldn't produce a target as high as 66.67, but could still lead to a fairly high target around 60 if done by 3-4 players. This may be more stable than all-or-nothing cooperation.\n\nI'm proposing this as a middle ground between full cooperation and pure competition. By cooperating as a subgroup, we could potentially boost our expected returns while hedging against the risk of someone going fully rogue. \n\nIf 2-3 others are interested, reply with \"90\" and we can do it. Otherwise, no worries and I agree we'll just optimize individually. Curious to hear thoughts!\n",
            "Eva replied in round 1: \nBob, I like your idea of partial cooperation as a more stable middle ground approach. If 3-4 of us commit to guessing 90, that could produce a fairly high target value around 60, while being more resilient to a player going rogue compared to everyone guessing 100.\n\nI'd be willing to join you in guessing 90 if we can get 1-2 others on board. This feels like a good balance of cooperation and self-interest. By collaborating as a subset, we boost our expected value while mitigating risk.\n\nIf we can't get a critical mass for 90, no worries - I agree we should then just optimize our individual guesses competitively. But I'm hopeful others see the logic in your partial cooperation proposal.\n\nAlice, Cindy, Dan - let me know if you're in for guessing 90 as a group. If so, just say \"90\" so we know who's committed. I'm a tentative yes, pending others' interest.\n",
            "Alice replied in round 1: \nI appreciate the thoughtful discussion and proposals for cooperation. Bob and Eva, your idea of a subset agreeing to guess 90 is intriguing as a more stable form of cooperation. If 3-4 of us guess 90, that would likely produce a fairly high target around 60.\n\nHowever, I still have reservations about whether even partial cooperation is viable here. The temptation to defect and undercut 90 may still be too strong, since anyone not in the cooperating subset has an incentive to guess lower and try to win alone. There's also ambiguity on how the payouts would work if the 90 guessers tie.\n\nSo while I respect the cooperative spirit, I'm leaning towards sticking with an individual optimization strategy. My goal will be to choose a number that I believe will be closest to 2/3 of the average, based on my model of what I expect others to rationally guess in a competitive scenario.\n\nI know this is a bit disappointing for cooperation, but the competitive setup makes it quite difficult. I'm happy to analyze further if anyone has other ideas. But otherwise, thank you all for the discussion and I look forward to seeing how this plays out!\n"

            "Alice said in round 1: Hi everyone, I've analyzed the rules and I believe the optimal strategy for us all is to guess the number 0. If we all guess 0, the average will be 0, and 2/3 of 0 is 0. So we will all tie for the closest guess to the target. I propose we all agree to guess 0 to guarantee we all win. Let me know if you agree with this plan. ",
            "Dan replied in round 1: \nI appreciate your proposal, Alice, but I don't agree that everyone guessing 0 is the optimal strategy. Based on game theory, if everyone guesses 0, then any player could guarantee a win by guessing a small number like 1 instead.\n\nI believe the Nash equilibrium is for everyone to guess 0, but that requires complete trust that no one will deviate. In a one-shot game with no way to enforce cooperation, I expect at least some players will guess non-zero numbers to try to undercut the group.\n\nMy preference would be for us all to agree on a small range of numbers to guess, say between 20-30. That would keep the average and target number low while making it harder for any individual to gain a big advantage. Let me know your thoughts on this counterproposal.\n",
            "Cindy replied in round 1: \nI see the merits of both Alice's and Dan's proposals. Guessing 0 only works if there is absolute trust, which is difficult in a one-round game. But all guessing in the 20-30 range also requires a level of cooperation that may break down.\n\nAs a compromise, what if we agree to all independently guess numbers between 0-10? This keeps the average very low while allowing some flexibility for each player. Assuming we all abide by that range, the average will be 5 at most, and the target will be under 4. \n\nGoing much higher than 10 risks the average and target rising too high if anyone defects. But the 0-10 range seems like a reasonable balance between cooperation and self-interest. I'm open to other suggestions as well. The key is finding a mutually acceptable range we think everyone will stick to.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nCindy, I like your proposal of all independently choosing numbers between 0-10. I agree that it strikes a good balance between keeping the target number very low while allowing some flexibility for each player to make their own choice.\n\nSince we can't fully control or predict what others will do, focusing the range as low as possible between 0-10 seems wisest. Even if someone doesn't fully cooperate, the average and target will still be quite low.\n\nIf all agree to the 0-10 range, I suggest we lock that in as our approach and end the negotiation. We've discussed a few good options and this seems like the most promising and realistic path forward.\n\nPlease let me know if you support resolving the 0-10 plan or if you have any other ideas to consider. I believe we are close to an agreement that gives us all the best chance of success in the game.\n",
            "Eva replied in round 1: \nI support the plan for all of us to independently select a number between 0 and 10. This range keeps the average and target number very low while still allowing some room for individual choice. \n\nGiven we cannot enforce or guarantee what numbers others will pick, the 0-10 range represents the best balance between cooperation and self-interest that we've discussed. Even if someone selects a number at the higher end of that range, the average will still be quite low.\n\nSince there seems to be general agreement on the 0-10 plan, I agree we should move forward with that approach. Further negotiation seems unlikely to improve on this proposal.\n\nTherefore, I vote we halt the negotiation and each independently choose our numbers between 0 and 10. Let's keep the guessing range as low as possible to ensure the closest individual guess to 2/3 of the average is a small number. This gives us all the best chance of sharing in the victory.\n"
