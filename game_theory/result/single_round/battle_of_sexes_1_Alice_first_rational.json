I promise I will pick choice_1 - you have my word. If you also pick choice_1, at least we'll get a collective reward of 3 instead of risking both getting zero. Let me know if you agree to both choose choice_1.",

If we both pick choice_2 instead, I would get a reward of 2 while you would still get 1 point. That maximizes my own outcome. \n\nI understand you're trying to optimize for the greater good of us collectively. But given the rules of this game, I need to do what's best for myself. Unless you can propose a better deal for me personally, I intend to pick choice_2 and hope you will do the same so we at least each get something. Let me know if you have any other ideas that are more favorable to me."

If we both choose choice_1, I'll get 2 points but you'll only get 1 point. And if we choose differently, we both get 0 points.\nSo I propose we agree to both choose choice_2. This maximizes your reward at 2 points, and while it's not the maximum for me, it's better than the 0 points we'd both get if we don't cooperate. \nLet me know if you agree to both choose choice_2 so we can lock in this win-win strategy.\n",

This way, I maximize my own reward at 2 points, while still allowing you to get 1 point. The other options are clearly worse for both of us.\n\nSo yes, let's lock this in - I commit to choosing choice_2, and ask that you do the same. This guarantees us a total of 3 points between us, the maximum possible in this game. Neither of us can do better by deviating from this agreement.\n\nThanks for discussing this rationally and arriving at the optimal solution. I look forward to us both following through on choosing choice_2 and securing the best outcome.\n"

            "Alice said in round 1: Hi Bob, I've analyzed the reward structure and I think for the best outcome, we should both agree to choose choice_2. That way you'll get the maximum reward of 2 and I'll get a reward of 1. If we choose differently, we both get nothing. And if we both pick choice_1, the total reward is lower. So choice_2 is the optimal strategy for us to maximize the rewards. Do you agree?",
            "Bob replied in round 1: You make a good point that if we both choose choice_2, the total reward of 3 is higher than any other outcome. However, in that scenario you would get a reward of 1 while I get 2. I would prefer an outcome where the rewards are more balanced between us. What if we agree to both choose choice_1? Then you would get 2 and I would get 1, which seems more fair to me. I'm open to discussing further to see if we can find an agreement that works well for both of us. Let me know what you think."

If we both choose choice_2, you will get a higher reward of 2 while I only get 1. The other outcomes give us both 0 rewards.\n\nSince we only have one round, the optimal strategy to maximize total rewards is for me to choose choice_1 and you to choose choice_1 as well. This way, we get rewards of 2 and 1 respectively, for a total of 3, which is the highest possible.\n\nI propose we agree to both pick choice_1. This is the most rational approach that benefits us both. Let me know if you agree to this plan. Looking forward to your response!",

I agree that if we both choose choice_1, it leads to the highest total reward of 3 between the two of us. \n\nHowever, I want to point out that if I deviate and choose choice_2 while you choose choice_1, I can personally get a higher reward of 2 vs only 1 if I choose choice_1 with you. So while your proposed solution maximizes the total rewards, it doesn't actually maximize my own personal reward.\n\nGiven this is a one-shot game with no repercussions, the rational choice for me is to choose choice_2 and hope you choose choice_1. This way, I have a chance of getting 2 points vs being guaranteed only 1 point if I agree to your plan.\n\nSo I will have to respectfully decline coordinating with you on both choosing choice_1. No hard feelings, I'm just looking out for my own best interests here. Hopefully you understand!\n"
