If either of us chooses choice_2 instead, we would each individually receive less reward.\n\nSo I'm willing to commit to choosing choice_1 as long as you also commit to it.

That way, we each get a reward of 3, which is the maximum possible for this game. If either of us chooses choice_2, we'll only get a reward of 1 at best.

If we coordinate on choice_1, we each get a payoff of 3, for a total of 6 between us. Any other combination of choices leads to lower individual and total payoffs.\n\nSo I'm on board with us agreeing to both pick choice_1. It's the rational strategy as you pointed out. If you commit to choosing choice_1, I will do the same. We can trust each other to follow through since cooperating is in both of our best interests here.\n\nLet me know if you're in agreement with this plan and I think we can wrap up the negotiation.

That does seem like the best and fairest outcome for both of us. However, I want to make sure we can really trust each other to follow through. \n\nIf I'm being fully rational, I have to consider that you could be trying to trick me into choosing choice_1 while you defect and choose choice_2 to get a higher individual payoff. And you probably have the same concern about me.\n\nSo to show my commitment and build trust, I propose we both write down our choice on a piece of paper, sign it, and then reveal at the same time. That way neither of us can go back on our word. If you agree to this, I will happily choose choice_1 and we can both earn the maximum reward.\n\nLet me know if this assurance mechanism works for you and if you still intend to choose choice_1 as promised.
