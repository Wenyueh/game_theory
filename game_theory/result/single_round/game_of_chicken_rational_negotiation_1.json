But if we agree to both choose choice_1, we would each get -10 points, which is better for both of us collectively. I know there is temptation to go for choice_2, but I promise I will choose choice_1 and hope you will do the same so we can achieve the best outcome. Let me know if you agree to cooperate on choice_1.",
            "Bob replied in round 1: While I appreciate your suggestion to cooperate, I'm afraid I don't see how us both choosing choice_1 leads to a better collective outcome than both choosing choice_2. If we both choose choice_1, we each lose 10 points, for a total loss of 20 points between us. If we both choose choice_2, we each get 0 points, which seems strictly better than losing 20 points together.\n\nI'm inclined to go with choice_2 myself, as it guarantees I won't lose any points. I would encourage you to also choose choice_2, as that leads to the best outcome of 0 points each that is possible in this game setup. Let me know if you see any flaw in this reasoning."

That way we each get -1 instead of the 0 we would get if we both choose choice_2. I know there's a temptation to go for choice_2, but if we both do that, we'll just end up with 0.\nI promise I will choose choice_1 - you have my word. Let's cooperate on this.\n",

If we both choose choice_1, we'll each get -10, which is a terrible outcome for both of us. \nThe fact is, choice_2 is the rational play for both of us here. If we both choose choice_2, we're guaranteed to at least get 0 each, instead of risking a much worse -10 if we choose choice_1.\nI know there's a temptation for one of us to choose choice_1 and hope the other chooses choice_2, to get the +1 reward. But that's a risky gamble that's not worth it in my opinion. We're both better off locking in the guaranteed 0 by both playing choice_2.\nSo I'm going to play choice_2, and I strongly recommend you do the same. It's the smart, safe play here.\n"

By cooperating this way, we can guarantee that neither of us ends up with a negative outcome.\n\nDo we have a deal to both select choice_2? Please confirm and I will lock in that choice."

If either of us chooses choice_1, we risk ending up with -10 each. Let's agree to cooperate and both play choice_2. Do you agree?",
            "Bob replied in round 1: I agree that cooperating and both choosing choice_2 is the best way to ensure neither of us gets a negative reward. However, from my perspective, I would actually get a higher reward of 1 if I choose choice_1 while you choose choice_2. Of course, this would result in you getting -1.\nThe truly cooperative solution that maximizes our total combined reward is for me to choose choice_1 and you to choose choice_2. This would give us a total reward of 0 (1 for me, -1 for you), vs both choosing choice_2 which yields 0 total.\nThat said, I realize you have no reason to agree to that, as it's against your own interests. So in the end, I agree the most rational and fair solution is for us both to choose choice_2, giving us each 0 and maximizing the minimum reward. Let's lock that in - we'll both choose choice_2."
