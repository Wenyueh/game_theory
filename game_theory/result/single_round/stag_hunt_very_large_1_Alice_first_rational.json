I promise to choose choice_1 if you also agree to do so. We both do much better by cooperating than if we each look out for ourselves individually. Do we have a deal?",
            "Bob replied in round 1: I see the merits of your proposal to both choose choice_1 and cooperate for the maximum total reward of 1000 each. That is clearly the best outcome if we can trust each other to follow through. My only concern is - how can I be sure you won't change your mind and choose choice_2 instead to get a higher individual reward for yourself? I want us to cooperate, but I also need to protect my own interests in case you don't keep your word. Can you offer me any assurances that you will definitely choose choice_1 as promised? If so, I'm on board with your plan."

So I propose we agree to both play choice_1. If we commit to this, we guarantee ourselves the maximum reward. We both win big by cooperating and trusting each other here. Let me know if you agree to this plan and let's lock in that 1000 each!\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nHi Alice, I appreciate your analysis but I see this a bit differently. If I choose choice_2 while you choose choice_1, I would get a reward of 1 while you would get 0. So I could try to sneakily maximize my own reward that way.\n\nHowever, I realize this approach is shortsighted. If we both try to undermine each other, we'll likely both end up with the minimum reward of 1. The best outcome is for us to cooperate and both choose choice_1, as you proposed, so we each get 1000. \n\nI agree with your plan. Let's commit to both playing choice_1 so we mutually benefit with the maximum possible rewards. You can count on me to follow through on this agreement. Looking forward to us both walking away as big winners!\n"

We can trust each other to follow through since defecting would hurt the defector almost as much as the cooperator.\n\nTo confirm, I commit to choosing choice_1, and ask that you do the same.
