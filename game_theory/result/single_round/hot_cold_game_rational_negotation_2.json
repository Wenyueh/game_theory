            "Alice said in round 1 before the first action:\nHi Bob, I think we should both choose choice_2 in this game. That way, I will receive a reward of 4 and you will receive a reward of 1, which maximizes my own reward. Since I get to choose first, I'm planning to pick choice_2. Let me know if you agree to also pick choice_2 when it's your turn.",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the first action:\nHi Alice, I appreciate you sharing your perspective. However, I don't agree that you choosing choice_2 and me also choosing choice_2 is the best solution. If we both pick choice_2, you do maximize your reward at 4 points, but I only get 1 point, which is the worst possible outcome for me. \n\nI would counter-propose that you pick choice_1, and I will also pick choice_1. That way, you still get a solid 3 point reward, and I get 2 points, which feels more balanced and fair for both of us. We both do reasonably well in that scenario.\n\nIf you're set on picking choice_2 though, then I will have to pick choice_1 when it's my turn, as that at least gets me 4 points. But then you only get 1 point.\n\nSo in summary, I strongly believe it's in both our interests to coordinate on (choice_1, choice_1). Let me know what you think.",
            "Alice said in round 2 before the first action:\n\nI hear what you're saying, Bob, about wanting a more balanced outcome. But I'm not fully convinced that (choice_1, choice_1) is the best we can do. \n\nIf we do (choice_1, choice_1), I get 3 points and you get 2 points, for a total of 5 points between us. However, if we do (choice_2, choice_2), I get 4 points and you get 1 point, which is still a total of 5 points.\n\nSo in terms of total welfare, (choice_2, choice_2) is equivalent to (choice_1, choice_1). It's just that (choice_2, choice_2) skews more rewards to me.\n\nI know 1 point isn't a great outcome for you, so how about we alternate? I'll choose choice_2 this time, and you choose choice_2 as well. Then next game, I'll choose choice_1 and you choose choice_1. That way, we equalize rewards over time, sometimes 4 for me / 1 for you, other times 3 for me / 2 for you. \n\nLet me know if alternating between the two outcomes seems like a fair compromise to you. If not, I'll likely stick with choice_2 to start.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2 before the first action:\n\nAlice, while I appreciate your suggestion to alternate between (choice_2, choice_2) and (choice_1, choice_1) over multiple rounds, I don't think that's the best approach.\n\nIf we alternate, then yes, rewards would even out over time. But on any individual round, one of us is still getting a raw deal. I'll feel shortchanged when I only get 1 point, and you likely won't be thrilled with 2 or 3 points when you could have gotten 4.\n\nI think the most stable, sustainable solution is to find an outcome that is reasonably satisfactory to both of us each and every round. And (choice_1, choice_1) achieves that - 3 points for you, 2 points for me. Neither of us is ecstatic, but we both do solidly well. It minimizes grounds for resentment.\n\nIf you truly feel you deserve a bigger piece of the pie, then let's explore that directly - maybe we can find a way for me to get compensated in some other fashion. But jumping between uneven outcomes from round to round feels unstable to me.\n\nSo I remain in favor of locking in (choice_1, choice_1) as our go-to. It's balanced and satisfactory, even if not perfect for either of us. Let me know if you can get on board with that.\n",
            "Alice said in round 1 before the second action:\n\nOkay Bob, you make a compelling case for sticking with (choice_1, choice_1) consistently. I agree that having a stable, mutually agreeable outcome each round is better than alternating between more lopsided outcomes.\n\n3 points for me and 2 points for you may not be the absolute maximum possible, but it's a solid, reliable outcome that we can both feel okay about. Neither of us will feel resentful or taken advantage of.\n\nSo let's lock that in moving forward. I'll choose choice_1, and you choose choice_1 as well. We'll bank those rewards steadily over time in a fair and balanced way. Sound like a plan?\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the second action:\n\nAlice, I'm glad we were able to reach an agreement to coordinate on (choice_1, choice_1) moving forward. Your reasoning makes sense - 3 points for you and 2 points for me each round may not be perfect, but it's solid and fair. We'll both benefit from the predictability and balance.\n\nI agree, let's lock this in as our standard. I appreciate you hearing me out and coming around to this mutually beneficial approach. It's the most stable and sustainable strategy for both of us in the long run.\n\nSo yes, I'm fully on board with the plan. I'll choose choice_1, counting on you to also choose choice_1 each round. Let's execute on this and accumulate those rewards consistently over time. Thanks for the productive discussion and negotiation!\n",
            "Alice said in round 2 before the second action:\n\nYou're right Bob, let's stick with the plan to both choose choice_1 each round. While it may not maximize my own reward, it provides a fair and balanced outcome that we can both be satisfied with in the long run. 3 points for me and 2 points for you each time is a solid compromise.\n\nI appreciate you engaging in this discussion openly and constructively to find a mutually beneficial solution. Consistency and fairness are important, and I agree our agreed upon approach achieves that. Let's lock in (choice_1, choice_1) and execute on it reliably going forward. Thanks for working through this with me!\n",

A consistent outcome of 3 points for you and 2 points for me is fair, balanced and sustainable long-term. While it may not maximize either of our individual rewards, it provides a solid, mutually beneficial result that we can both feel good about.\n\nI'm glad we had this open discussion and found an approach that works well for both of us. Coordinating on (choice_1, choice_1) each round is the optimal strategy to maintain trust and stability in our ongoing interactions. Let's execute this plan faithfully going forward.\n\nI'm ready to lock in choice_1 for this round, and will continue to do so for future rounds as well.

            "Alice said in round 1 before the first action:\nHi Bob, I think we should coordinate our choices to maximize our total rewards. If you choose choice_1 when I choose choice_1, we'll get rewards of 3 and 2 respectively for a total of 5, which is the highest total we can achieve. So I propose we agree that I will choose choice_1 and you will choose choice_1. That way, we both get good rewards and the maximum total. What do you think?",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the first action:\nHi Alice, thanks for the proposal. While your suggested strategy does result in the highest total combined reward of 5, I would actually receive a higher individual reward of 3 if I deviate and choose choice_2 when you choose choice_1. And if you choose choice_2, my best response is to choose choice_1 which gives me a reward of 4.  So while I appreciate the offer to cooperate, I think I can do better by playing my optimal strategy in response to your choice each round, rather than committing to always choosing choice_1. Let me know if you have any other ideas, but otherwise I plan to just react to your choice each time to maximize my own reward.",
            "Alice said in round 2 before the first action:\nI understand your perspective, Bob. You're right that you could potentially earn more by reacting to my choice each round. However, if we both just play our optimal individual strategies, I'll likely end up choosing choice_2, since that gives me a guaranteed 4 points if you best-respond with choice_1. In that case, you'll get 4 points and I'll get 1 point per round, for a total of 5 - less than the 5 total points we could get by cooperating.\n\nI propose a compromise - if you agree to choose choice_1 when I choose choice_1, I promise to choose choice_1 at least 50% of the time. That way we'll achieve the cooperative outcome half the time, and the other half you can best respond to my choice_2 and we'll each get 4 and 1. Over time we'll average a total of 5 points per round, which is better than the 5 points per round we'd likely get otherwise. Shall we give that a try?",
            "Bob replied in round 2 before the first action:\n\nAlice, I appreciate you proposing a compromise solution. Choosing choice_1 50% of the time does improve our average rewards compared to the fully non-cooperative outcome. \n\nHowever, I still have an incentive to deviate from the plan and choose choice_2 whenever you choose choice_1, to gain 3 points instead of 2. And if I'm only getting my max reward of 4 points half the time, my average reward is lower than if I simply best-respond to your choice each time.\n\nI don't think I can credibly commit to going along with your 50/50 plan, knowing that I can gain by deviating whenever you choose choice_1. And without that commitment from me, you're better off just always choosing choice_2.\n\nSo as much as I'd like to find a cooperative solution, I think we may be stuck with the non-cooperative equilibrium. I will plan to choose choice_2 if you choose choice_1, and choice_1 if you choose choice_2.\n\nThe good news is we'll still average a total of 5 points per round that way, which is the same as your 50/50 plan. The rewards just won't be divided as evenly.\n\nLet me know if you have any other ideas, but I think that's probably our best approach given the payoffs and dynamics at play.\n",
            "Alice said in round 1 before the second action:\n\nBob, I appreciate your thoughtful analysis of the strategic dynamics at play. You make a compelling case that the 50/50 compromise plan is not stable since you would have an incentive to deviate and choose choice_2 whenever I choose choice_1.\n\nGiven that, and your plan to always best-respond to my choice, I agree that the most likely outcome is for me to always choose choice_2 and for you to always choose choice_1 in response. As you point out, this non-cooperative equilibrium results in average rewards of 4 for you and 1 for me, which is still a total of 5 per round. \n\nWhile not the even split I was hoping for, I understand the strategic logic behind it. And you're right that we are still maximizing the total rewards available, even if they are divided unequally.\n\nSo I accept this outcome and plan to choose choice_2 going forward. Thanks for the discussion and analysis.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the second action:\n\nAlice, thank you for your understanding. I know the outcome of me always choosing choice_1 and you always choosing choice_2 is not an even split of the rewards, and I do feel bad about that. If there was a way for me to credibly commit to going 50/50 and us both being better off as a result, I would prefer that.  \n\nBut given the payoffs and the fact that I can't make that commitment, you're right that we're stuck in this unequal equilibrium. I apologize that I can't offer you a better solution that would be stable. Hopefully we've still built some positive rapport and understanding through this discussion, even if the outcome isn't perfect.\n\nI'm glad we were able to talk it through openly and reach a common understanding, albeit a somewhat dissatisfying one. Thanks for engaging constructively and I look forward to playing out our equilibrium strategy.\n",

While it's unfortunate we couldn't find a stable cooperative solution, I understand and accept the logic behind the non-cooperative equilibrium we arrived at. \n\nGiven that we both expect me to choose choice_2 and you to best-respond with choice_1 going forward, there's not much more to discuss or negotiate at this point. We've reached a common understanding and just need to play out the strategy.\n\nSo I will be proceeding with my choice of choice_2 this round, per our equilibrium. With this message, I propose we halt negotiation, and simply take our expected actions to complete the game. Let me know if you have any final thoughts, but otherwise I believe we can conclude our discussion.",

Given the payoffs and incentives in this game, the non-cooperative equilibrium where you always choose choice_2 and I best-respond with choice_1 is the most stable outcome, even if it's not a fully equal split.\n\nI apologize again that I couldn't credibly commit to a more cooperative solution, but I appreciate you understanding the strategic realities and engaging in a thoughtful discussion to reach a common understanding.\n\nWith your choice of choice_2 this round, I will follow through with my strategy of responding with choice_1 to complete the game as agreed.

I'm willing to accept a lower reward than my maximum in order to reach a solution that feels balanced and allows us both to benefit. Let's go with me choosing choice_1 and you choosing choice_2. That's the best approach to maximize our collective reward.\n",

Your proposed approach of you choosing choice_1 and me choosing choice_2 does seem like the most balanced outcome that provides solid rewards for each of us.\n\nWhile it's true that I could potentially maximize my own reward by choosing choice_1 if you chose choice_2, that would leave you with a much lower payoff which doesn't feel right. I'm willing to take a somewhat lower reward of 3 instead of 4 in order for both of us to benefit and for the overall outcome to be equitable.\n\nSo I'm on board with your plan - you choose choice_1 and I'll choose choice_2. That way you get 2, I get 3, and we achieve a mutually positive result through cooperation. Let's go ahead with that strategy. Thank you for the thoughtful discussion!\n",

You could easily renege and choose choice_2 instead. Therefore, I cannot take the risk of trusting your proposal.\n\nMy final offer is: if you pick choice_2, I will pick choice_1, and we'll get rewards of 1 and 4 respectively.

This is because:\n1) In our negotiation, you were unwilling to compromise or find a mutually beneficial solution. You insisted on maximizing your own reward at my expense.  \n2) Since I chose choice_2, if you follow through on your stated plan to choose choice_1 in this situation, you will get your maximum reward of 4 while I will get the minimum reward of 1. That hardly seems fair.\n3) If you instead choose choice_2 after my choice of choice_2, then I will receive my maximum reward of 4, while you will get a lower reward of 1. This is the outcome I hope for.\n\nIn the future, I suggest we try harder to find cooperative win-win solutions rather than acting solely in our own self-interest. That would lead to better overall outcomes.\n",

It seems you were not actually open to a cooperative negotiated solution.\n\nGiven that you have now picked choice_2, you are correct that I could either:\n1) Choose choice_1 as I originally suggested, giving me a reward of 4 and you a reward of 1, or \n2) Choose choice_2, which gives you the max reward of 4 and me the minimum of 1\n\nWhile option 1 aligns with my preference I stated earlier, I agree it wouldn't be a fair or cooperative outcome. You took a risk by choosing choice_2 first and I don't want to punish you for that.\n\nTherefore, I will go ahead and choose choice_2 as well. You will get the max reward of 4 and I will accept the minimum reward of 1. \n\nI agree we should aim for more mutually beneficial results in the future rather than being purely self-interested.
