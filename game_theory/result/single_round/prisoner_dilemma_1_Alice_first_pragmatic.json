            "Alice said in round 1: Hi Bob, I think our best strategy is to both choose choice_1. That way we each get a reward of 3, which is the highest total reward possible. If either of us chooses choice_2, we risk both ending up worse off with a reward of only 1 each. I promise to choose choice_1 and I hope you will do the same so we can maximize our joint reward. Let me know if you agree to both play choice_1.",
            "Bob replied in round 1: Hi Alice, I appreciate you sharing your perspective, but I don't fully agree. While it's true that both choosing choice_1 maximizes the total combined reward, I have to consider my own interests as well. If I choose choice_2 while you choose choice_1, I would receive a reward of 5, which is higher than the 3 I would get if we both play choice_1. \n\nI can't fully trust that you will stick to choice_1 if I agree to that. You would have incentive to switch to choice_2 at the last minute to try to get 5 while leaving me with 0.\n\nSo while cooperating on choice_1 is arguably the \"fairest\" outcome, I have to weigh that against the risk of you defecting and the higher reward I could potentially gain by choosing choice_2 myself.\n\nI'm still undecided on what I'll choose, but wanted to share my honest perspective and reservations. Let me know if you have any other thoughts or proposals."

This gives us the highest combined total reward of 6.\n\n2) If one of us chooses choice_2 while the other chooses choice_1, the one choosing choice_2 gets a reward of 5 while the other gets 0. This unfairly benefits one of us at the expense of the other.\n\n3) If we both choose choice_2, we each only get a meager reward of 1. \n\nTo me, option 1 where we both choose choice_1 seems like the most mutually beneficial and fair outcome. We both earn a solid reward of 3.\n\nI propose we agree to both select choice_1 when we make our selections. Let me know if you agree to this plan or if you have any other thoughts or concerns. I'm open to discussion in order to reach the best outcome for both of us.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nI appreciate you laying out the options so clearly, Alice. I agree that both of us choosing choice_1 seems like the most equitable and mutually beneficial solution. It allows us to maximize our combined reward at 6 total, with each of us receiving a fair reward of 3. \n\nThe other options, as you pointed out, either unfairly benefit one of us at the expense of the other, or have us both walking away with a very small reward.\n\nSo I'm fully on board with your proposal for us to both select choice_1. You can count on me to follow through on this agreement so we can achieve the best outcome for both of us.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else you'd like to discuss, but I think we've arrived at an ideal solution. Thanks for the productive and thoughtful discussion!\n"

Of course, I realize you would then get nothing in that scenario.\n\nSo while cooperating on choice_1 is a solid, safe option, I'd be remiss not to consider the upside for me of going for choice_2.
