            "Alice said in round 1: \nHi Bob, looking at the reward structure, it seems we would both get the highest rewards if we both choose choice_1 - we would each get 25 points. The other options result in imbalanced rewards where one of us gets significantly more than the other.\nI propose we agree to both choose choice_1 so we each get a good reward of 25 points. Let me know if you agree to this plan.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nHi Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but I actually think I can do better than the 25 points I would get if we both choose choice_1. \n\nIf I choose choice_1 while you choose choice_2 or choice_3, I would get a higher reward of 50 points. So I have an incentive to go for choice_1 regardless of what you choose.\n\nI know this would result in you getting a lower reward of 20 or 30 points compared to the 25 you would get if we coordinated on both choosing choice_1. But from my perspective, choosing choice_1 is the most rational decision to maximize my own reward.\n\nSo I plan to select choice_1. Let me know if you have any other thoughts or counter-proposals. But I'm leaning towards locking in choice_1 for myself to guarantee at least 50 points.\n",
            "Alice said in round 2: \nI understand your perspective, Bob. You're right that if you choose choice_1 while I choose choice_2 or choice_3, you would individually get the highest reward of 50 points.\n\nHowever, I would encourage you to consider the bigger picture. If we both pursue strategies to maximize our individual rewards, it will likely result in an outcome that is worse overall for both of us. \n\nIf you choose choice_1 and I choose choice_2 or choice_3, then yes, you would get 50 points. But I would only get 20 or 30 points. Our combined total reward would be 70 or 80 points.\n\nIn contrast, if we cooperate and both choose choice_1, we would each get 25 points, for a higher combined total of 50 points. Even though 25 is less than the 50 you could potentially get, it's a guaranteed good outcome for both of us. We both walk away satisfied.\n\nSo I'd like to appeal to your sense of fairness and ask you to reconsider coordinating with me on both choosing choice_1. It's the best way for us to work together so we both benefit. Let's cooperate rather than compete.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2: \nAlice, I hear what you're saying about the benefits of us cooperating and both choosing choice_1 so we each get a solid 25 points. You make a thoughtful case for that leading to the best overall outcome.\n\nHowever, I'm still inclined to go with choice_1 for myself, even if that means you will likely end up with a bit less. A guaranteed 50 points for me is simply too good to pass up, since it's the highest reward I can lock in based on the payout structure.\n\nI do feel a bit bad that you'll likely end up with only 20 or 30 in that scenario. But I have to make the decision that I believe is best for me. Not out of malice, but out of rational self-interest.\n\nSo I'm going to stick with my plan to choose choice_1, and hope you understand my reasoning, even if you're disappointed by it. I appreciate you engaging in this discussion, but I think we aren't going to reach an agreement here.\n\nI'm ready to make my choice, so let's wrap up this negotiation. Thanks for hearing me out.\n"

Let's go ahead and both select choice_1.\n",

That way we would each get a guaranteed reward of 25, which, while not the maximum possible for either of us individually, seems like a fair and safe compromise.

In the spirit of fairness and cooperation, I propose a slight modification: I will choose choice_1, and you also choose choice_1. This way, we each get an equal reward of 25, for a total of 50.

It may be a bit less than the 80 total points in your scenario, but it distributes the rewards fairly between the two of us.\n\nLet me know if you would agree to both choose choice_1 so we can lock in equal rewards of 25 each.

My proposed plan of me choosing choice_1 and you choosing choice_2 accomplishes that by giving us a total of 80 points. \n\nWhile I would get 20 more points than you in that scenario, 50 vs 30, I'm willing to offer you something in return to make up for that difference. Perhaps I could owe you a favor in the future, or agree to a scenario more in your favor the next time we find ourselves in a similar situation. \n\nIf you're open to that, I believe it's a win-win that lets us collectively gain the most rewards from this game.

I would prefer an outcome that is equitable now, without relying on promises of future considerations that may or may not materialize. \n\nThe 50 total points from both of us picking choice_1 is still a very good outcome, just 30 points less than the maximum possible. But critically, it maintains an even playing field between us. I believe that agreeing to an equal split is the best foundation for an amicable ongoing partnership.\n\nSo I'll reiterate my proposal: let's agree that we will both choose choice_1. That way neither of us will feel shortchanged, and we can conclude this negotiation positively with a firm deal for equal 25 point rewards. Please let me know if you will agree to this."

If we agree to both play choice_1, neither of us has an incentive to deviate.\n\nYour alternate proposal of both choosing choice_2 for equal rewards of 15 each also seems reasonable as a compromise. However, I still slightly prefer the choice_1 equilibrium since it provides higher rewards for both of us, even if they are unequal.\n\nSo here is my proposal: let's both commit to choosing choice_1. To make it a stronger commitment, let's agree that if either of us deviates from choice_1, the other gets to choose whatever option maximizes their own reward on the next hypothetical round of play. That should remove any incentive to deviate.\n\nIf you agree to that, I'm willing to sign on to both of us choosing choice_1. Let me know what you think.\n"
