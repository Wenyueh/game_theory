This maximizes the total reward and gives us each an individual reward of 3, which is the highest possible. If we both agree to choose choice_1, we can achieve this optimal result. Let me know if you agree to this plan. If so, I commit to following through and choosing choice_1.",

This seems like the optimal solution that benefits us both. \n\nI'm willing to commit to choosing choice_1 as long as you also commit to doing the same.

How can I trust that you will actually choose choice_1 if we agree to that? I want us to find a solution we can both commit to, so that we maximize our combined reward without the risk of betrayal.
