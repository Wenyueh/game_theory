            "Bob replied in round 1: Hi Alice, I appreciate your suggestion, but I don't think it's the best strategy for us. If we both choose choice_2, we'll each end up with a reward of -4, which is the worst outcome. The only way for either of us to get a positive reward is if one chooses choice_2 while the other chooses choice_1. In that case, the one who picks choice_2 gets a reward of 2 while the other gets 0.\n\nI think we should agree that one of us will choose choice_1 and the other choice_2. That way, one of us is guaranteed to get a reward of 2, which is better than risking both getting -4. Let me know if you agree with this plan and which choice you prefer. I'm fine with either option."

This way, I'll get a reward of 2 and you'll get 0, which isn't great for you but at least isn't negative. \nIf we both choose choice_2, we'll each lose 4 points, which is terrible for both of us. I definitely want to avoid that outcome.\nSo I strongly recommend you pick choice_1, and I'll pick choice_2. Let me know if you agree with this approach. Thanks!\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nHi Alice, thanks for your message. I appreciate you analyzing the game, but I respectfully disagree with your proposed approach. If I choose choice_1 and you choose choice_2 as you suggest, then you get a reward of 2 while I get nothing. That's a great outcome for you but not for me.\n\nI believe the fairest solution is for me to choose choice_2 and for you to choose choice_1. That way, I'll get a reward of 2 and you'll get 0. I agree we should avoid both choosing choice_2 as that's bad for both of us. \n\nBut there's no reason I should accept getting 0 points while you get 2. The symmetric outcome where I get the 2 points and you get 0 makes more sense as a compromise.\n\nSo I propose I choose choice_2 and you choose choice_1. Let me know if you agree. If not, I think we're at an impasse and should halt the negotiation.\n"

            "Bob replied in round 1: \nHi Alice, I appreciate you sharing your perspective. However, I don't think it's in my best interest to choose choice_1. Here's my reasoning:\n\nIf we both choose choice_1, we each get 0 points. But if I choose choice_2 while you choose choice_1, I get 2 points while you get 0. So choice_2 is clearly the better option for me individually.\n\nThe risk is if we both choose choice_2, we each lose 4 points. But I'm willing to take that gamble for the chance at gaining 2 points.\n\nSo while I respect your suggestion, I plan to choose choice_2 regardless of what you do. I understand if you feel you need to choose choice_1 to protect yourself from the -4 outcome. But I'm going to optimize for my own result here.\n\nLet me know if you have any other thoughts or want to discuss further. But that's my stance based on the rules and payouts of this particular game.\n"
