That way, we each get a reward of 3, which maximizes the total reward at 6. If either of us chooses choice_2, the total reward will be lower - either 5 if one chooses choice_2, or 2 if we both do. \n\nSo I propose we agree to both pick choice_1. That's the rational strategy to get the best result for both of us. Let me know if you agree to this plan.",
            "Bob replied in round 1: Thanks Alice, I appreciate your analysis. I agree that both of us choosing choice_1 maximizes the total reward at 6, which is the best collective outcome. Choice_2 leads to worse results overall.\n\nHowever, I need to consider my personal incentives too. If you choose choice_1 and I choose choice_2, I would get a reward of 5 while you get 0. That's the best individual outcome for me. \n\nSo while I see the logic in cooperating, I'm concerned you may defect and choose choice_2, leaving me with a zero reward. \n\nCan you help assure me that you are fully committed to choice_1 so I can trust that you won't defect? If so, I'm open to going with the mutually optimal choice_1 strategy you proposed. Let me know your thoughts."

However, I've also noticed that if I choose choice_2, there is a possibility for me to get a higher individual reward of 5, if you end up choosing choice_1. \n\nWhile I don't want either of us to end up with 0, I do want to do what's best for myself. I'm considering choosing choice_2 to have a shot at the higher payoff. \n\nThat said, I recognize choosing choice_1 is the safest option that ensures we both get a decent reward.

How can I be absolutely certain you won't be seduced by that possibility and choose choice_2, leaving me with nothing?\n\nI want to trust your promise that you'll pick choice_1 if I do too - but this is a competitive game and we are not long-time allies.
