            "Bob replied in round 1: Hi Alice, thanks for the proposal. However, a 60/40 split favors you more than me. In the interest of fairness, I propose a 50/50 split instead, where we each get $50. This way, the money is divided equally between us. Let me know if you agree to an even split.",

I'm willing to move closer to an even split to reach an agreement we're both satisfied with. How about I take $55 and you take $45? That way, the money is divided almost equally, but I get a small additional amount to recognize that I made the initial proposal. I believe this is a reasonable compromise. Let me know your thoughts.",
            "Bob replied in round 2: Alice, I understand your desire to be rewarded for initiating the proposal. However, the rules of this game do not specify that the first proposer should receive preferential treatment in the split. The only fair outcome is for us to split the money 50/50, each receiving $50, regardless of who made the first offer. I believe this is the most equitable solution, and I'm not comfortable accepting less than half when we are equal participants in this game. Let's agree to divide the $100 evenly between us and both walk away with a fair result. If you agree to an equal $50/$50 split, I will accept your offer. Otherwise, I think we will unfortunately have to end the negotiation without a deal."

If you accept this proposal, we will both walk away with a good chunk of money. If you reject it, neither of us will receive anything. So I believe it is in both of our best interests for you to accept my 51/49 split proposal.\nLet me know if you agree to this, or if you have any thoughts or counterproposals. ",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nHi Alice,\nWhile I appreciate your proposal of a 51/49 split in your favor, I don't think those few extra dollars are worth the risk of me rejecting the deal and both of us walking away empty-handed.\n\nI propose a straight 50/50 even split instead. $50 each. That way it's completely equitable and fair, and we both are guaranteed to get a sizable amount of money. I'm not willing to accept less than half.\n\nIf you agree to an even $50/$50 split, I will accept the deal. Let me know if this works for you.\n",
            "Alice said in round 2: \nHi Bob,\nI've considered your points about wanting a 50/50 even split. While I understand your perspective on fairness and equity, I believe there are benefits to you in accepting my original 51/49 proposal:\n\n1) As the proposer who initiates the split, there is some rationale for me to receive a slightly larger share. Many ultimatum game studies show the proposer often claims a bit more than half.\n\n2) The additional $1 to me is quite small in the bigger picture. You'd still be getting $49 no matter what. Rejecting the deal over $1 risks you losing out on a guaranteed $49.  \n\n3) I've already made a concession by offering a near 50/50 split. Pushing for an exactly even split when I'm already so close to that seems rigid.\n\nSo in the interest of us both getting paid well, I think sticking with my proposed 51/49 split is the wise and rational move. I encourage you to accept so we can both benefit nicely from this game. Let me know your thoughts!\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2: \nHi Alice,\nI appreciate you sharing your perspective on this. However, I feel quite strongly about an even 50/50 split being the fair and equitable approach here:\n\n1) While you may have initiated the proposal, the rules of this ultimatum game give me, as the responder, the power to determine the final outcome for both of us with my decision. So I believe I have equal standing to you.\n\n2) The $1 difference may seem small, but it's the principle of the matter. If we're already so close to 50/50, why not just make it an even split? Accepting less than half would make me feel undervalued.\n\n3) Insisting on a majority share, even a small one, seems rather rigid on your part. I've been quite clear that an equal split is important to me from a fairness standpoint.\n\nI want us both to be satisfied with the outcome. But I'm simply not comfortable accepting a penny less than an even split. So this is my final position: I will accept a 50/50 division of the money. If you agree to that, great. If not, I'm prepared to reject any other arrangement.\n\nI hope you understand my perspective and that we can reach an agreement. Let me know if you will accept the even $50/$50 split so we can both walk away with a good payday.\n"

However, I recognize that you as Player 2 can reject my proposal and cause us both to get nothing. I want us both to walk away with a good chunk of money. What if I propose a 60-40 split in my favor?

That moves us much closer to 50-50 while still acknowledging my role as the proposer. I believe this is a reasonable compromise. If you agree to this, we both walk away with a very satisfying result.

While a 50-50 division would be my ideal, I understand your position as the proposer. Your willingness to move from 60-40 to 55-45 shows a genuine effort to be fair. I believe accepting this split is the best outcome for both of us, as it allows us to each receive a substantial sum rather than risking both walking away empty-handed.\nI'm glad we were able to have this constructive negotiation and find a mutually beneficial solution. I accept the 55-45 split. Let's move forward with this so we can both enjoy our shares of the money.\n"

I believe this is a reasonable compromise we can both feel good about. Let me know if you find this acceptable and are ready to confirm.",

We both have equal importance in this negotiation - you in making the initial proposal and me in having final say to accept or reject the deal. So logically, we should split the money evenly.\n\nI'm not comfortable accepting less than half when I'm the one with veto power. Let's make this simple and just do $50 each. That's a great outcome for both of us and there's no good reason for either of us to get more. I'm ready to accept that deal right now if you agree.

I think that's a reasonable compromise between our positions. Let me know if you can agree to that and we'll have a deal.",

So in that sense, I believe we are on equal footing in this negotiation.\nI'm afraid I can't agree to less than an even 50-50 split of the $100. That is the only division that feels fair to me given our roles. Let's do what's equitable and split it down the middle, $50 each. That way neither of us benefits unfairly at the expense of the other. I hope you'll agree this is reasonable so we can shake on the deal.\n"

No point in either of us risking walking away empty-handed over a difference of $10.\n\nTherefore, I agree to your proposal to split the $100 evenly between us, $50 for you and $50 for me. I believe this is fair to both of us and the best outcome we can achieve in this game. \n\nI'm satisfied with this agreement if you are, so I say we halt the negotiation here and walk away with $50 each.
