If we both pick choice_1, we each get a reward of 3, which is the highest possible reward. All the other combinations lead to large negative rewards for both of us. So cooperating on choice_1 is clearly the optimal strategy to maximize our individual rewards. Let me know if you agree that we should both commit to choosing choice_1. I think it's in both our best interests.",
            "Bob replied in round 1: Hi Alice, I agree with your analysis that both of us choosing choice_1 is the optimal strategy to maximize our individual rewards in this game. If we cooperate and both pick choice_1, we each get the maximum possible reward of 3. Any other combination of choices leads to significant negative rewards for both of us.\n\nGiven the structure of the payoffs, it's clear that coordinating on (choice_1, choice_1) is the rational solution that leaves us both better off. I'm willing to commit to choosing choice_1 if you will as well. Cooperating is definitely in our mutual best interest here.\n\nSo let's agree to both play choice_1 when we submit our choices for this round. That will ensure the best outcome for both of us. Please confirm if you're on board with this cooperative strategy.",
            "Alice said in round 2: Absolutely, I fully agree that cooperating and both choosing choice_1 is the clear optimal strategy. The payoff matrix makes it obvious that (choice_1, choice_1) maximizes the reward for each of us individually. We both receive 3 points in that scenario, which is vastly better than the negative payoffs in all other cases.\n\nGiven our mutual agreement to cooperate, I commit to selecting choice_1 when I submit my choice for this round. You have my word that I will follow through on this. \n\nSince we're on the same page about playing (choice_1, choice_1), I believe we can conclude our negotiation and submit our choices. There's no need for further discussion as continuing to cooperate is clearly in both our best interests.\n\nThanks for working with me to reach the optimal solution! Let's submit choice_1 and secure our maximal rewards.",
            "Bob replied in round 2: \nI appreciate you honoring our agreement to cooperate, Alice. Your commitment to selecting choice_1 is noted and valued. I want to reiterate that I also commit fully to choosing choice_1 when I submit my choice.\n\nGiven our mutual understanding and commitment to the cooperative (choice_1, choice_1) strategy, I agree there is no need for further negotiation. We have aligned on the optimal solution that maximizes rewards for both of us individually. \n\nSo let's move forward with submitting choice_1 as we discussed, secure our 3 points each, and conclude this round on the best possible terms for both of us. I'm grateful we were able to work together to achieve the ideal outcome.\n\nThank you for the productive discussion and your cooperation. I look forward to us both receiving the maximum rewards.\n"

            "Alice said in round 1: \nHi Bob, based on the rules of this game, it seems that the only way for both of us to avoid a highly negative outcome is if we both choose choice_1. If either of us chooses choice_2, we will both end up with a reward of around -100.\nHowever, if we both cooperate and choose choice_1, we can each get a positive reward of 3. I think our best strategy to maximize both our rewards is to agree to both pick choice_1.\nWhat do you think? Can we agree to cooperate so we both come out ahead? Let me know if you're willing to both choose choice_1.\n",

The only way for us to avoid that and actually get positive rewards is by both choosing choice_1 and cooperating.\n\nI'm willing to commit to choosing choice_1 as long as you do the same. That way we each get a reward of 3, which is much better than the alternative. If we both stick to choice_1, it's a win-win.\n\nSo let's agree to cooperate and both go with choice_1.

By working together, we ensure the best outcome for both of us.\n\nSince we're in agreement, I think we can end the negotiation here and lock in our choices. I promise to choose choice_1 and I trust you'll do the same. Let's stop discussing and submit our choices. \n\nThanks for cooperating - because of our agreement, we'll both come out of this with a positive reward, which is the best possible result.
