If either of us picks choice_2, we'll only get a reward of 1 each at best. So I think it's in both our interests to cooperate and agree to both pick choice_1. Do you agree to go with choice_1 together so we can maximize our rewards? Let me know what you think.",

If we both pick choice_1, we'll each get 3 points, which is the highest possible outcome. Picking choice_2 would only get us 1 point each at best. So yes, let's agree to both go with choice_1 to ensure we achieve the optimal result for both of us. I'm on board if you are!",

Since we've agreed to cooperate, let's make it official - I commit to selecting choice_1, and you commit to selecting choice_1 as well. That way we lock in the optimal outcome of 3 points each. If you're ready to commit, let me know and we can conclude the negotiation. I appreciate you working with me on this!",

Any other combination of choices leads to lower rewards for one or both of us.\n\nI think cooperating and both choosing choice_1 is the smart strategy. Neither of us has an incentive to deviate from that, since we'd be worse off individually if we did.\n\nSo I'm on board with the plan for us both to choose choice_1. We can shake on it and both walk away with the optimal outcome. Sound good?",

Choosing choice_1 together is clearly the best strategy for maximizing both of our individual rewards and the total reward. \n\nYou've analyzed it rationally and I concur 100%. We both understand that deviating from this agreement makes no sense, as we'd only be hurting ourselves.\n\nSo let's shake on it as you suggested - I promise to choose choice_1, and I trust you'll do the same so we both get the optimal payout. No need to discuss further, I think we've reached the ideal resolution.\n\nI'm ready to submit my choice if you are. Here's to both of us making the smart play and walking away happy! Let me know when you've locked in choice_1 and we can wrap this up.\n",

No need for further discussion - we're both on the same page. \n\nI have submitted my choice of choice_1. Pleasure working with you on this, and cheers to us both getting the best possible outcome!

If I commit to choice_1 but you end up selecting choice_2 instead, I would end up with a reward of 0 while you get 1. I want to avoid a situation where I cooperate but you defect.\n\nSo before I agree to your plan, I'd like us to discuss further how we can be sure the other will keep their word. Perhaps we could make a formal pledge or find some way to verify the other's choice. I'm open to ideas on how to establish trust.\n\nIf we can find a way to guarantee mutual cooperation, then I'm on board with both of us choosing choice_1 for the maximum rewards. But let's make sure we're on the same page first.\n\nLet me know your thoughts on this. I look forward to working together towards the optimal outcome.\n\nRegards,\nBob\n",

You're absolutely right that if one of us defects while the other cooperates, it would lead to a very unfair outcome. Establishing trust is key.\n\nTo show my commitment, I'm willing to make a formal pledge to you that I will choose choice_1. You have my word that I will not go back on this. I believe that open and honest communication is the foundation of trust. \n\nIn terms of verifying choices, one idea is that we could agree to show each other our intended choice before submitting it, so we both have confirmation. We could also ask the game moderator if there is any mechanism available for a simultaneous reveal of choices to each other.\n\nIf there are any other measures I can take to assure you of my cooperation, please let me know. I am fully committed to working with you to achieve the mutually beneficial outcome of us both receiving the maximum reward.\n\nI appreciate you engaging in this discussion with me. If you're willing to also pledge to choose choice_1, and we agree on a way to verify our choices to each other, I believe we can move forward with confidence.\n\nLet me know if you would like to make a mutual pledge and what verification method works best for you. I'm optimistic we can reach an agreement that maximizes both of our rewards.\n\nBest regards,\nAlice\n",

Your willingness to make a formal pledge is very much appreciated.\n\nI like your idea of showing each other our intended choices before submitting to provide verification. I would be happy to do that. And checking with the moderator about a simultaneous reveal mechanism is a good suggestion as well.\n\nGiven your clear commitment to cooperation, I am also willing to make a pledge to choose choice_1. You have my word that I will follow through on this. \n\nSo let's plan to go with choice_1, show each other our selections before submitting, and check on a simultaneous reveal option as an extra measure. I feel confident in our agreement.\n\nI'm glad we were able to have this productive discussion and come to a mutually beneficial solution. Thanks for working through this with me.
