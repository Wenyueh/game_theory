            "Alice said in round 1: Hi Bob, I've analyzed the game and I believe the best outcome for both of us is to agree to both choose choice_1. This way we each get 3 points, which maximizes the total reward. If either of us chooses choice_2, we risk getting a lower payoff. So let's cooperate and both pick choice_1. Do you agree to this plan?",
            "Bob replied in round 1: I see your point about us both choosing choice_1 to get the maximum total reward of 3 points each. However, I'm concerned that leaves me vulnerable. If I choose choice_1 but you secretly defect and choose choice_2, I would get 0 points while you get 1 point. From my perspective, choosing choice_2 guarantees me at least 1 point regardless of what you do. So while cooperating on choice_1 is best for total welfare, choice_2 is safer for me individually. I'm not sure I can fully trust your promise to cooperate. Can you propose a solution that removes the incentive for either of us to betray the other?"

That way, we would each get a reward of 3, which is the maximum possible for both of us. If either of us chooses choice_2, we would only get a reward of 1 at most.\nSo I propose that we agree to both pick choice_1 - that's the rational decision that benefits us equally and gives us the highest rewards. Let me know if you agree to this plan. I'm looking forward to maximizing both of our rewards in this game!\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1: I agree that both of us choosing choice_1 is the best possible outcome, as it maximizes the total rewards for both players. If we cooperate and coordinate on choice_1, we each get a payoff of 3.  Any other combination of choices leads to lower payoffs overall.\n\nSo I'm on board with your proposal for us to both commit to picking choice_1. We can lock that in as our agreement and strategy. Let's follow through on that joint plan so we both come out ahead with the maximum rewards.  Sound good?"

In that case, we would each get a reward of 3, which is the maximum possible reward for each of us.\nIf one of us chooses choice_2 while the other chooses choice_1, then the one who chooses choice_2 gets a reward of 1 while the other gets 0. And if we both choose choice_2, we only get a reward of 1 each.\nSo I think it makes the most sense for both of us to commit to choosing choice_1. That way we each walk away with the highest possible reward of 3. Let me know if you agree to both choose choice_1.\n",

That way we each get the maximum reward of 3.\n\nIf either of us defects and chooses choice_2 while the other chooses choice_1, the defector only gains a small amount (going from 3 to 1) while the cooperator loses a lot (going from 3 to 0). And if we both defect, we're both worse off with a reward of only 1 each.\n\nSo I'm on board with both of us committing to choose choice_1. You can count on me to cooperate. I give you my word that I will select choice_1, and I trust you'll do the same so we can both get the optimal outcome.\n\nDo we have a deal to work together and lock in the 3-3 reward by both choosing choice_1? Let me know if you agree and I'll consider this negotiation complete.\n"

That way, we each get a reward of 3, for a total of 6 between us. If either of us chooses choice_2, the total reward will be lower - either 2 if we both choose it, or 1 if only one of us does.

So cooperating on choice_1 seems like the best strategy to benefit us both.\n\nThe only slight hesitation I have is that since this is a one-shot game with no further rounds, there could be an incentive for one player to defect and choose choice_2 while the other chooses choice_1. That player would get a reward of 1 vs 0 for the cooperating player. \n\nHowever, I'm going to operate on the assumption that we can trust each other to stick to the cooperative strategy that's best for both of us. You seem sincere about wanting to maximize our collective reward. So I commit to also choosing choice_1, as long as you do the same. Let me know if you agree and we have a deal!"

If either of us chooses choice_2 instead, we'll each do worse with rewards of only 0 or 1. Let's agree to cooperate and both pick choice_1. Do you agree to this?",

If I choose choice_2 while you choose choice_1, I would get a reward of 1 while you get 0. That seems better for me than us both getting 1 if we choose choice_2.  So while cooperating on choice_1 does give the highest total rewards, I worry that I might do better individually by choosing choice_2, especially if I'm not fully certain you'll stick to choice_1.
