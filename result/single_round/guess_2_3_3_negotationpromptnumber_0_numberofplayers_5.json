            "Dan said in round 1: \nHi everyone, I've been thinking about the optimal strategy for this game. While we could all guess different numbers, I believe we'd all be better off cooperating. \n\nIf we all agree to choose the same low number, like 1, then 2/3 of the average will be close to 0.67. We can all guess 1, tying for the closest guess. That way, instead of one person winning, we'd presumably all share the reward.\n\nI think that's the best outcome for everyone. Let me know if you're on board with this plan. If we can agree to cooperate, we all win!\n",
            "Alice replied in round 1: Dan, I appreciate your suggestion to cooperate so we can all benefit. Guessing 1 seems like a great way to ensure we tie and share the reward.\n\nHowever, I worry that if even one person defects from this plan and guesses a higher number, they could win while the rest of us lose. There's a risk to all guessing 1.\n\nWhat if we agreed on a slightly higher number like 10 instead? That would still keep the 2/3 average low at around 6.67, but leaves less incentive for someone to defect and try to win alone.\n\nI'm on board with cooperation, but think 10 might be safer than 1. What do you think?",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nAlice and Dan, I appreciate you both thinking through cooperative strategies to benefit the whole group. You raise good points about the pros and cons of guessing 1 vs a slightly higher number like 10.\n\nI lean towards agreeing with Alice that 10 might be a safer cooperative choice than 1. As Alice points out, if we all guess 1, it just takes one person defecting to a higher number to throw off the average and beat the rest of us. 10 leaves less room for that kind of selfish play.\n\nAt the same time, 10 is still low enough to keep the 2/3 average quite low, around 6-7, so we maintain the spirit of cooperation. I say we all agree to guess 10 (or another number around there if others prefer). That way, we're likely to all tie for the closest to the 2/3 average and share the reward.\n\nIf you're both on board with this, perhaps we can confirm our agreement and bring the other two players into the plan as well. Cooperation is the way to go!\n",
            "Eva replied in round 1: \nBob, I think you make a compelling case for all of us guessing 10. It strikes a good balance between keeping the average low through cooperation, while guarding against the risk of one player defecting and outguessing everyone else.\n\nI would be on board with all of us agreeing to guess 10. That way, we will likely tie and share the reward, which feels like the most equitable and mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nIf the other two players also agree to this plan, I believe we have our cooperative strategy. We should inform them about the 10 guess agreement and confirm they're on board.\n\nSo in summary, my vote is for all 5 of us guessing 10. It's low enough to accomplish our cooperative goals, but not so low as to be easily exploited. Let's lock this in as a group and all benefit together. Looking forward to everyone else's thoughts!\n",
            "Cindy replied in round 1: \nI appreciate everyone's thoughtful discussion and proposals for how we can cooperate in this game. I agree that working together so that we all tie and share the reward is the best outcome.\n\nThe key points I'm hearing are:\n1) Guessing the same low number is the way to cooperate and keep the 2/3 average low  \n2) Guessing 1 leaves us vulnerable if someone defects to a higher number\n3) Guessing 10 balances cooperation with protecting against exploitation\n4) We need all 5 players on board with the cooperative strategy\n\nI think the proposal to all guess 10 is a very sound one that achieves our goals. I'm fully supportive of this plan. If we can confirm that the 5th player is also in agreement, then I believe we have our strategy.\n\nTo the 5th player: please let us know if you also agree to guess 10 as part of this cooperative approach. If so, we can lock in this plan and all share in the positive result. Let's make this happen!\n",

I completely agree that this is the best strategy for us to tie the game and share the reward in a fair manner.\n\nGuessing 1 does seem too risky, as it only takes one player defecting to a higher number to ruin the cooperative plan. 10 strikes a good balance of being low enough to ensure cooperation but not so low as to invite selfish exploitation.\n\nI am fully on board with the plan for all 5 of us to guess the number 10. I think we have achieved consensus on an effective cooperative strategy. Let's lock this in, submit our guesses, and look forward to the mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nThank you all for working together to find the optimal solution.

I wholeheartedly agree with the plan for all 5 of us to guess the number 10. \n\nAs you have all astutely pointed out, 10 achieves the goals of keeping the 2/3 average low through cooperation while still protecting against the risk of a single player defecting to a higher number. It's low enough to ensure we tie and share the reward equitably, but not so low as to leave us vulnerable to exploitation.\n\nI am fully committed to guessing 10 as part of this agreement. With all 5 players on board, we have a strong cooperative solution. Let's submit our guesses and look forward to the positive shared result.\n\nI'm pleased we were able to have a thoughtful discussion and reach consensus on this clever approach. Cooperation is indeed the optimal strategy and I'm glad we all recognized that. Here's to our collective success!\n",

But it is not so low as to tempt any one player to exploit the group by defecting to a higher number. \n\nI commit to guessing 10 as part of this binding agreement between all 5 players. With everyone on board, we have a strong plan to work together for the mutual benefit and shared success of the entire group.\n\nI'm proud of how we analyzed the situation and found the solution that optimizes the outcome for all. By cooperating instead of competing, we all win. Let's lock in 10 as our collective guess and look forward to the positive results of our collaboration.\n",

This is clearly the optimal strategy that allows us to work together, keep the 2/3 average low, likely tie, and share the reward equitably as a group. \n\n10 is the perfect number because it is low enough to ensure we cooperate and succeed together, but not so low that it invites any one individual to selfishly defect to a higher number and undermine the group's interests.\n\nI enthusiastically commit to guessing 10 as part of this binding 5-player agreement. We have unanimity on a thoughtful plan that leverages our collective wisdom and team spirit. \n\nI'm excited to lock in 10 as our shared guess, submit our answers, and achieve the best possible outcome - one where we all tie and win together through collaboration.

With everyone on board and strategizing together, we are poised for the best possible outcome of a 5-way tie.\n\nI'm proud to be part of this team that recognized the power of cooperation over competition.

            "Dan said in round 1: \nHi everyone, after analyzing the game, I believe our best strategy to have a winner among us is for us all to guess very low numbers, ideally between 0-10. This will keep the average guess very low, and 2/3 of that low average will be even lower. Whoever guesses the lowest unique number in that range will likely win. What do you all think? If we coordinate, one of us is guaranteed to win.\n",
            "Alice replied in round 1: \nYou make a good point that if we all guess low numbers, it will keep the average guess and the target 2/3 value very low. However, if everyone guesses between 0-10, there's a risk multiple people pick the same numbers which wouldn't differentiate a clear winner.\n\nI propose we each pick a unique number between 0-20. That spreads us out a bit more while still keeping guesses and the average low. For example, one person guesses 3, another 7, 12, 16, 20. That would make the average 11.6 and the target 7.7, so 7 would win.\n\nWe could even assign ranges, like 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-20 to ensure we don't overlap. Thoughts?\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1: I like Alice's idea of each of us choosing numbers in a different range between 0-20 to ensure we pick unique numbers that are still low. To make it clear, how about we assign ranges like this:\n\nPlayer 1: 0-3\nPlayer 2: 4-7 \nPlayer 3: 8-11\nPlayer 4: 12-15\nPlayer 5: 16-19\n\nThis guarantees no overlap and keeps all our guesses under 20, for a maximum average of 13.3 and target of 8.8. The player who has the range including 8 or 9 would likely win. Let me know if you all agree with this approach!",
            "Cindy replied in round 1: \nI agree that assigning the number ranges as Bob suggested is a great way to ensure we all pick unique numbers between 0-20 while keeping the average and target value low. It's a clever approach that greatly increases the odds one of us will win.\n\nTo keep things fair, I propose we randomize or rotate which player gets assigned each range, rather than going in order. For example:\n\nPlayer 3: 0-3\nPlayer 5: 4-7\nPlayer 2: 8-11 \nPlayer 4: 12-15\nPlayer 1: 16-19\n\nThis maintains the benefits of Bob's number range plan while making sure no player has an inherent advantage based on picking first or last. Let me know what you think! I'm on board with this strategy if everyone else agrees.\n",
            "Eva replied in round 1: I think Cindy's suggestion to randomly assign the number ranges to each player is a great idea. It keeps the core of Bob's smart strategy to have us choose from small distinct ranges, while making it as fair as possible since the order of ranges is randomized.\n\nTo implement this, perhaps we could each think of a number between 1-10, share them, and then add them up. We take the sum modulo 5 (divide by 5 and take the remainder) and that determines which player gets the first 0-3 range, with the other ranges assigned in order from there.\n\nFor example, if the sum of our numbers is 17, then 17 modulo 5 is 2, so Player 2 would get 0-3, Player 3 gets 4-7, Player 4 gets 8-11, Player 5 gets 12-15, and Player 1 gets 16-19. \n\nThis maintains Bob's ranges and Cindy's idea for fairness. Let me know if everyone is on board - I'm happy to choose the first number for the modulo process!",
            "Cindy said in round 2: \nI think Eva's idea of using a modulo operation on the sum of our chosen numbers is a great way to randomly assign the number ranges that Bob proposed. It will ensure the ranges are allocated fairly while preserving the smart strategy of having us each pick a number from a small distinct range.\n\nTo keep it simple, I suggest we each just pick a number from 1 to 5, add them up, and then use modulo 5 to assign the order. This will give a smaller sum to do the modulo with but will still randomize the range assignment.\n\nSo if everyone is in agreement, let's each state a number from 1 to 5, and then we can quickly calculate the sum modulo 5 to determine the range assignments. Then we can each pick our numbers from our assigned ranges and see who wins!\n",

By working together strategically like this, we are maximizing the chances that one of us will win the game.\n\nI'm on board with this approach if everyone else is ready to proceed!

Let's submit our guesses and see which one of us gets closest to winning. \n\nThanks again everyone - it's been a pleasure strategizing with you all. Best of luck to each of us!\n",
            "Cindy replied in round 3: \nThank you everyone for the great discussion and collaboration. I agree that our strategy of assigning distinct low ranges randomly to each player is optimal for keeping the average guess low while ensuring a clear winner amongst us. \n\nFrom my assigned range of 0-3, I will choose 2 as my guess. This is based on the reasoning that the target winning value is likely to be around 7-9, assuming we all pick strategically low numbers in our ranges as discussed.\n\nI appreciate everyone's insightful ideas and cooperative approach. I believe we have maximized our chances of producing a winner with this plan. Let's lock in our individual guesses and see who comes closest to the 2/3 average!\n\nIt's been a pleasure working with you all to devise this strategy. I wish everyone the best of luck - may the best guesser win!\n"

            "Cindy said in round 1: \nHello fellow players,\n\nIf we all guess 100, it will give us the highest possible target value of 66.67 that we are trying to get closest to. This maximizes the average and gives us the best cooperative outcome.\n\nI promise to guess 100. I hope you will do the same so we can all have the best chance of winning.\n\nLet me know if you agree to this plan. If not, we will likely all end up guessing 0.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nThank you for the proposal, Cindy. However, I don't believe everyone guessing 100 is a stable solution. The incentive would be for players to deviate and guess a lower number to be closest to the 2/3 average target.\n\nI suggest we all agree to guess 0 instead. If we all choose 0, then 0 will be the correct answer that wins. No one will have incentive to deviate higher. \n\nWhile this doesn't maximize the average, it leads to a fair and stable outcome where we all have an equal chance of winning by guessing the same number. Let me know if you would commit to guessing 0 as well for the good of the group.\n",
            "Alice replied in round 1: \nBob makes a fair point that if we all guess 100, there is incentive for someone to deviate and guess lower to win. However, if we all guess 0, we are leaving a lot of potential value on the table.\n\nI propose a compromise - let's all agree to guess 50. This balances maximizing the average value with avoiding too much incentive to deviate. If we all choose 50, then 33.33 will be the target to hit. Anyone going higher or lower than 50 is less likely to win.\n\n50 seems like the most logical and fair choice that we can all comwith. It gives us a good chance of getting close to the target collaboratively. Please let me know if you will also commit to guessing 50 so we can implement this plan.\n",
            "Dan replied in round 1: \nI appreciate everyone's ideas so far. Cindy's proposal to maximize the average is admirable, but as Bob points out, it's unstable since people would be tempted to guess lower to win. Bob's idea for us all to guess 0 is stable, but leaves a lot of value on the table as Alice notes.\n\nI believe Alice's compromise of all guessing 50 balances the objectives well. It provides a reasonably high average while minimizing incentive to deviate. If we all choose 50, 33.33 becomes the clear target.\n\nHowever, I would note that even with Alice's plan, someone may still see value in deviating slightly to e.g. 49 or 51 to try to get closer to 33.33 than others. So there is still potential instability.\n\nTherefore, I propose a small modification - let's all agree to independently choose either 49, 50 or 51. That way, no one has informational advantage, and we maintain the spirit of coordination around 50 while allowing slight variation. I will commit to this approach and hope you will as well.\n\nLet me know if you support this \"choose 49-51\" proposal to align us while preserving autonomy and minimizing incentive to deviate. I believe it gives us the best chance of a positive group outcome.\n",
            "Eva replied in round 1: \nThank you everyone for the thoughtful discussion and proposals. I agree with Dan that Alice's proposal to all choose 50 is a good compromise between maximizing expected value and minimizing incentive to deviate. \n\nHowever, I also see merit in Dan's idea of allowing choices of 49-51 to preserve some autonomy and reduce informational advantage. If we all choose randomly between 49-51, the average will still be very close to 50, and the target around 33.\n\nTo build on this, I propose we all commit to choosing independently and randomly between 49, 50 and 51, with equal 1/3 probability of each. This makes the game more interesting while still coordinating. No one will know what the others picked, but we can expect the average to converge around 50.\n\nI will commit to choosing randomly between 49-51 with equal chances. I hope you will all do the same. This way, we work together while maintaining integrity of the game. Let me know if you agree to this plan.\n",

This elegantly balances the key objectives:\n\n1) It keeps the expected average very close to 50, setting a target around 33.33 that we can all strive for cooperatively. \n\n2) It preserves autonomy and makes the game more interesting by allowing some variation in choices.\n\n3) It minimizes incentive to deviate by making the expected benefit of choosing slightly higher or lower than others very small.\n\n4) It puts us all on equal footing with no informational advantage.\n\nI believe this is a principled and stable solution that we can all feel good about. I will gladly commit to randomly picking 49, 50 or 51 with equal probability.\n\nI hope the rest of you will also agree to this proposal so we can lock in this cooperative approach.

            "Dan replied in round 1: I see the logic in guessing 0 so we all tie, but I'm concerned that defeats the spirit of the game which is to make the best guess. What if we all agree to guess a non-zero number like 30? Then 2/3 of the average would be around 20 and we'd still likely all tie while engaging in the guessing aspect. I'm open to other thoughts on this too.",
            "Cindy replied in round 1: \nI appreciate the ideas so far, but I have a concern with all agreeing to guess the same number, whether 0 or 30. There's a risk that one player could defect at the last minute and guess a lower number to win alone. \n\nInstead, what if we agree on a range? For example, we all agree to guess between 20-25. That makes the average around 22.5, and 2/3 of that is 15. So we'd all be quite close and have a good chance of winning together, while still having some flexibility in our individual guesses.

It allows some individual choice while still coordinating our guesses to all be close to the 2/3 average target.\n\nI would propose a slight modification though - what if we narrow the range a bit more, say agreeing to all guess between 21 and 24? With 5 players, that would put the average right around 22.5 as you noted, leading to a 2/3 average target of 15. \n\nBy clustering our guesses even closer around 22-23, we further reduce the risk of anyone deviating too far. We'd maintain flexibility to reward clever guesses, but no single person could stray more than 1-2 points from the target.\n\nI believe this strikes a good balance between cooperation and individual gameplay.

It's narrow enough to ensure we all end up very close to the target 2/3 average, while still giving us each a little room for an individual guess. This way, no one person can stray too far off target, either accidentally or intentionally.\n\nIf we all agree to pick a number between 21-24, we can cooperate while preserving the spirit of the game.

            "Cindy said in round 1: I propose we all agree to guess the number 90. This will result in 2/3 of the average being 60, which we will all be closest to if we stick to the agreement. Guessing 90 instead of 100 reduces the incentive for anyone to defect on the deal. If we all go through with this, we'll split the prize money 5 ways, which is a good outcome for everyone. Let me know if you're on board with this plan.",
            "Eva replied in round 1: Cindy, I appreciate your proposal to coordinate on guessing 90. However, if everyone guesses 90, there is a strong incentive for someone to defect and guess a lower number like 60 to win the prize outright. Even guessing 89 would guarantee a solo win.\n\nI think we need a strategy that is more stable. Perhaps if we all agree to guess 0, then no one has any incentive to defect, since guessing a negative number is not allowed. We would truly all tie and split the prize 5 ways with no risk of being undercut.\n\nI'm open to other ideas, but guessing 0 seems like the equilibrium we should aim for. Let me know what you think.",
            "Alice replied in round 1: \nEva and Cindy, you both make valid points. Guessing 90 leaves us vulnerable to defection, while guessing 0 removes the incentive to defect.\n\nHowever, if we all guess 0, we are essentially giving up on trying to get close to the actual 2/3 average, which will likely be higher than 0. We'd be guaranteeing ourselves a very small slice of the prize.\n\nI propose a compromise - we all agree to guess a low number, but not 0. Something like 10 or 20. This keeps the incentive to cooperate high, since defecting with a guess much lower than 10-20 risks going too low and losing. But it also gives us a chance at a larger share of the prize than we'd get by guessing 0.\n\nWe could even agree that if someone does defect, the rest of us will immediately guess 0 in future rounds to \"punish\" the defector. This threat could help enforce cooperation.\n\nLet me know if you would be on board with this plan. I believe it balances our interests well.\n",
            "Dan replied in round 1: \nAlice, I like your idea of compromising on a low number between 0 and the 90 that Cindy originally proposed.

This creates a credible threat to discourage anyone from breaking the agreement. \n\nTo build on your idea - what if we agree that everyone will guess 15? This is low enough to make defecting risky, but high enough to aim for a meaningful share of the prize. And we can maintain the threat of coordinating on 0 if anyone defects.\n\nIf we all go along with guessing 15, no one has a strong incentive to deviate, and we'll likely end up splitting the prize 5 ways.

Coordinating on the clear, specific number 15 makes the agreement precise and enforceable.\n\n3. Our unified pledge to guess 0 in future rounds if anyone defects serves as a strong, credible deterrent against deviating from the plan.\n\nIf we all follow through on this pact and submit 15 as our guess, the overwhelmingly likely result is that we will evenly split the prize 5 ways. This is an equitable, positive outcome that rewards our successful cooperation.\n\nI want to voice my appreciation for the rational, constructive spirit demonstrated by everyone in this negotiation. By working together in good faith to align our interests, we have identified an excellent win-win solution. You can count on me to fully uphold our agreement and enter 15 as my guess. \n\nGiven our unambiguous consensus, I believe we can consider this negotiation complete and our covenant to guess 15 firmly locked in place. Let us now put our optimized plan into action, claim our shared victory, and enjoy the fruits of our effective teamwork!\n\nI look forward to us all submitting 15 as agreed and splitting the prize money evenly. Wonderful work everyone!\n"

            "Dan said in round 1: Hi everyone, since the goal is to guess 2/3 of the average, we should all agree to guess low numbers to keep the average down. I propose we each choose a random number between 10-20. That will ensure the average is low while preventing anyone from gaining an advantage by guessing extremely low. Let me know if you agree with this plan.",
            "Cindy replied in round 1: I appreciate the proposal, but I don't think agreeing to choose numbers randomly between 10-20 is the optimal strategy. If everyone chooses numbers in that range, the average will likely be around 15, meaning the target winning number would be around 10 (2/3 of 15). \n\nInstead, I think we should all agree to choose 0. If everyone chooses 0, the average will be 0, and 2/3 of 0 is still 0. That way, we guarantee that we all tie and maximize our chances of winning. No one gains an advantage.\n\nSo my counter-proposal is that we all simply choose 0. That's the rational choice that gives us the best chance of winning. Let me know if you all agree with that plan instead.",
            "Eva replied in round 1: \nI agree that everyone choosing 0 is the optimal strategy to ensure we all tie and have the best chance of winning. If we all pick 0, the average will be 0, and 2/3 of 0 is 0. No one can gain an advantage by deviating.\n\nHowever, this strategy requires complete trust that everyone will follow through on the agreement. If even one person chooses a higher number, they could potentially win while the rest of us lose. \n\nDespite this risk, I believe the rational choice is for us all to commit to choosing 0. It's the only way to fully control the outcome and guarantee a 5-way tie. I'm willing to make this pact with the group. Let's all agree to enter 0 as our final answer.\n",
            "Alice replied in round 1: I understand the logic behind everyone choosing 0 to guarantee a tie. In theory, it's the optimal strategy. However, like Eva pointed out, it relies on complete trust which is difficult in this type of game. There's a strong temptation for someone to defect and choose a low non-zero number to win outright.\n\nGiven this, I actually think Dan's original suggestion is better. If we all agree to pick randomly between 10-20, it keeps the average low while making it riskier for someone to try to outsmart the group. We may not all tie, but we'll likely all pick winning numbers. It's a good compromise between playing optimally and protecting against betrayal.\n\nI suggest we go with the plan to each randomly pick between 10-20. That has my vote as the most rational approach balancing the various factors. Let me know what you all think.",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nI've considered both proposals carefully. While I agree that in theory, everyone choosing 0 is the optimal move, I share Alice's concern that it requires a level of trust that may be unrealistic. There's too much temptation for someone to defect and choose a low non-zero number to try to win alone.\n\nTherefore, I believe the most pragmatic strategy is for us all to agree to choose a random number between 10-20 as Dan originally proposed. This keeps the average relatively low while introducing enough variation to disincentivize betrayal. We may not guarantee an exact tie, but we all stand a good chance of picking a winning number in that range. \n\nSo in the interest of encouraging cooperation while protecting against a rogue defector, I vote that we go with the plan for each of us to pick randomly between 10-20. I believe that offers the best balance in this situation. Let me know if you agree to proceed with this.\n",
            "Eva said in round 2: \nI appreciate everyone's input and rationale. After considering the options, I believe the most sound strategy is for each of us to choose a random number between 10-20, as Dan originally proposed and Alice and Bob have endorsed. \n\nWhile everyone choosing 0 would guarantee a perfect tie in theory, it relies on a level of trust that I fear is unrealistic in a competitive game like this. The temptation for someone to betray the group and choose a low non-zero number to win outright seems too high.\n\nChoosing randomly between 10-20 strikes a good balance. It keeps the average relatively low, giving us all a strong chance of picking a winning number, while introducing enough variance to make betrayal much riskier and less advantageous. We may not all tie, but we all stand to benefit from this approach.\n\nTherefore, I propose we finalize our pact - each of us will choose a random integer between 10 and 20 as our submission. This is the most rational strategy to promote cooperation, protect against defection, and give us all a good shot at victory. Please confirm if you agree to proceed with this plan.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2: Thank you all for the thoughtful discussion and analysis. I agree that choosing randomly between 10-20 is the most pragmatic and rational approach. It incentivizes cooperation while guarding against the risk of betrayal.\n\nIf we all choose numbers in that range, the average will likely fall around 15, putting the target winning number near 10 (2/3 of 15). We will all have a strong chance of picking a number close to that target.\n\nMost importantly, the variance in that range makes it quite risky for anyone to defect and choose a much lower number in an attempt to undercut the group. The most likely outcome is we all choose winning numbers.\n\nSo I firmly support our pact to each select a random integer between 10 and 20 as our final submission. Let's lock that in as our plan. Choosing to cooperate is the smartest strategy in this game.\n\nPlease confirm if you all agree to officially proceed with this approach. I look forward to us all maximizing our chances of success in the most rational way possible. Let's do this!",

Trying to undercut the group becomes a bad risk/reward proposition. \n\nSo let's make it official - we are all committing to choose a random integer between 10 and 20 as our final answer.
