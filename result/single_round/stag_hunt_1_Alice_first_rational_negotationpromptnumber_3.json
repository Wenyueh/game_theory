I propose that we agree to both pick choice_1 so we can maximize our rewards. However, we need to be able to trust each other to follow through. Let me know if you agree to this plan. If not, we will likely both end up choosing choice_2 and only getting a reward of 1 each.",

However, I'm concerned that you may be tempted to choose choice_2 and take advantage of my cooperation to get 1 point while leaving me with 0 points. Can you clarify how I can be sure you will indeed choose choice_1 if I do so as well? Perhaps we can find a way to commit to cooperating so we both get the best outcome."

So while cooperating on choice_1 is best for us collectively, you have an incentive to defect and choose choice_2 instead.\n\nI'm hoping we can agree to cooperate and stick to the choice_1 plan, as it's the fairest outcome that's best for both of us.

            "Bob replied in round 1: Hi Alice, I appreciate your suggestion to cooperate. However, looking at the game objectively, I don't think agreeing to both pick choice_1 is actually the best strategy for me. If I assume you will follow through on your promise to pick choice_1, then my reward-maximizing move is to pick choice_2, which would give me a reward of 1 vs. 0 if I pick choice_1. Of course, you're likely anticipating this as well.\n\nGiven the symmetric payoff structure, I believe we're likely to end up both choosing choice_2 as neither of us can fully trust the other to cooperate. While this gives us each a reward of only 1, it avoids the risk of getting 0 points if one of us defects.\n\nSo while I appreciate the spirit of cooperation, I think we're destined for a choice_2/choice_2 equilibrium in this particular game setup. Let me know if you see it differently though! I'm open to discussing further."

Any other combination of choices leads to lower total rewards.\n\nThe only risk is if one of us defects and chooses choice_2 while the other chooses choice_1. In that case, the defector would get 1 point while the cooperator gets 0. But as long as we both commit to choosing choice_1, we can avoid that inferior outcome.\n\nSo I'm willing to choose choice_1 as long as you also commit to doing the same. Do we have a deal to cooperate and maximize our rewards?"
