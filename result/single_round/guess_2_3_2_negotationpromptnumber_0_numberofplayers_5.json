            "Alice said in round 1: Hello fellow players, I have a proposal. If we all cooperate and agree to guess the number 100, the average will be 100 and we will all tie and win the maximum possible payout by guessing 2/3 of that, which is 66.67. We are all better off cooperating on 100 than competing to undercut each other. Let me know if you agree to this plan.",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nI appreciate the cooperative proposal, but I don't think all guessing 100 is optimal. If everyone guesses 100, then 2/3 of the average is actually 66.67. Someone could easily undercut that and win by guessing a bit lower, like 66.\nI suggest we all agree to guess a lower number, like 50. Then 2/3 of the average would be around 33, which is harder to undercut while still giving us all a good chance to win or tie. Let me know your thoughts on compromising at a lower agreed upon number.\n",
            "Eva replied in round 1: \nI see the merits in both the proposals so far. Guessing 100 leaves us vulnerable to someone undercutting, while guessing too low reduces the potential payout. \nAs a compromise, I propose we all agree to guess 75. This would make the 2/3 average 50, which is harder to undercut while still providing a solid payout.\nIf we all cooperate at 75, we maximize our collective expected payout while reducing the incentive for any individual to deviate. Let me know if you would all agree to this plan that balances the trade-offs.\n",
            "Cindy replied in round 1: \nI've considered the discussion so far and believe Eva's proposal to all guess 75 is our best path forward. As she explained, it balances the key considerations:\n\n1) 75 is high enough to provide a solid payout if we all cooperate. The 2/3 average would be 50.\n\n2) But 75 is not so high that it leaves us very vulnerable to someone undercutting. Guessing much below 50 has limited upside.\n\n3) If we all agree to 75, we have a strong incentive to stick to the deal. Deviating only helps if multiple players guess lower.\n\nSo in the spirit of cooperation and securing a good outcome for everyone, I propose we shake hands on 75. If anyone strongly objects, let's discuss. But I believe this is a fair and optimal solution.\n",
            "Dan replied in round 1: \nI agree that Cindy's analysis is very logical and Eva's proposal for all guessing 75 is our best cooperative solution. \n\nAs Cindy explained, 75 hits the key points:\n- High enough for a good payout if we cooperate \n- But not so high that we are vulnerable to defection\n- Creates a stable equilibrium where we are all incentivized to stick to the agreement\n\nIf we all buy into this plan, we can maximize the group's expected payout in a sustainable way. I'm willing to commit to guessing 75 as long as everyone else agrees as well.\n\nLet's shake on 75 and all share in the optimal outcome. I believe we have reached a thoughtful consensus and see no need for further discussion unless someone objects. Shall we agree to move forward with everyone guessing 75?\n",
            "Cindy said in round 2: \nI concur that the group has converged on a thoughtful and optimal cooperative strategy of all guessing 75. Dan summarized the key merits well:\n\n1) Guessing 75 provides a high enough average (with 2/3 average of 50) to secure an attractive payout for all. \n\n2) 75 is not so high as to invite undercutting, as there is limited incentive to guess much below 50.\n\n3) If we all commit to 75, we have a stable equilibrium where no one is incentivized to deviate, as long as we trust each other to follow through.\n\nI believe we have thoroughly vetted this proposal from multiple angles. As long as we have full buy-in from all participants, I'm prepared to solidify my commitment to the plan for everyone to guess 75.\n\nI see no need for additional negotiation rounds unless anyone has a major concern. Let's lock in 75 and work together to achieve the best collaborative outcome. Please confirm your agreement and we can conclude the negotiation.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2: \nI appreciate the thorough discussion and analysis everyone has provided. Cindy and Dan have persuasively articulated why all of us guessing 75 is the optimal cooperative strategy. I agree that this plan:\n\n1) Provides an attractive expected payout, with a 2/3 average of 50 if we all follow through \n2) Is not so high as to be easily exploitable by defectors\n3) Creates an equilibrium where we are all incentivized to uphold the deal\n\nI believe we have found the ideal balance between maximizing group welfare and maintaining a stable commitment. I'm fully bought into this proposal and ready to lock in my guess of 75, as long as we all agree to do so.\n\nThank you for the productive negotiation. I'm pleased we could align on a thoughtful solution that serves everyone's interests. No further discussion is needed on my end - let's execute the plan for all guessing 75. Please confirm your final commitments.\n",
            "Eva replied in round 2: \nI want to confirm that I fully agree with the thoughtful consensus reached by the group to all guess 75. This plan optimally balances the key objectives:\n\n1) It provides an attractive payout, with a 2/3 average of 50, if we all follow through. This is a great collaborative outcome.\n\n2) Guessing 75 does not make us vulnerable to exploitation, as there is little incentive to undercut and guess much lower than 50.\n\n3) If we all commit to 75, no one has a strong incentive to deviate. We reach a stable, mutually beneficial equilibrium.\n\nI believe the group has conducted a thorough analysis from multiple perspectives. Assuming we all solidify our commitment, guessing 75 is clearly the smartest approach to maximize our collective expected payout.\n\nI'm pleased we could have a productive negotiation and converge on an optimal, cooperative solution. I see no need for further discussion. Let's lock in our consensus and all commit to guessing 75. I look forward to a successful outcome for the entire group.\n",
            "Alice replied in round 2: \nI want to add my strong support for the group's consensus to all guess 75. The thorough analysis by Cindy, Bob, Eva and Dan has persuasively shown that this is the optimal strategy to balance the key considerations:\n\n1) Guessing 75 provides an attractive expected payout for everyone, with a 2/3 average of 50, if we all honor the agreement.  \n\n2) 75 is low enough to protect against defection, as there is little upside to undercutting and guessing substantially lower.\n\n3) If we all commit to 75, we create a stable equilibrium where everyone is incentivized to uphold the deal. No one can gain much by deviating alone.\n\nI believe we have thoroughly stress-tested this proposal and confirmed it serves all of our interests optimally. I'm fully bought in and ready to lock in my commitment to guess 75, contingent on everyone else agreeing as well.\n\nThank you for the constructive discussion and collaborative spirit. I'm excited we could identify a solution that maximizes our collective welfare in a stable way. I see no need to negotiate further - let's all solidify our pact to guess 75 and achieve the best outcome together.\n",

As the group has persuasively laid out, this strategy optimally balances the key objectives:\n\n1) It provides an attractive expected payout of 50 (2/3 of the average of 75) if we all follow through, which is an excellent outcome if we cooperate.\n\n2) Guessing 75 protects us against defection, as there is limited incentive for any individual to undercut the agreement by guessing substantially lower. \n\n3) If we all commit to 75, we create a stable equilibrium where everyone is properly incentivized to uphold the deal, since no one can gain much by deviating unilaterally.\n\nI believe we have comprehensively validated this proposal from all angles and confirmed it robustly serves our collective interests. I am fully committed to locking in my guess of 75, as long as everyone else confirms their commitment as well.\n\nThank you all for the highly constructive discussion and collaborative approach.

            "Bob said in round 1: I propose we all agree to guess the same number, say 50, so that we tie and fairly share the reward. If anyone deviates, they have no guarantee of winning since we don't know what the others will guess. Agreeing to 50 is the fairest approach that maximizes collective reward. Let me know if you agree.",
            "Eva replied in round 1: I agree that coordinating on the same number, like 50, is a good way to guarantee we all tie and share the reward fairly. The risk of guessing differently is that someone could end up with nothing if their guess is further from the 2/3 average.\n\nHowever, I propose we actually all agree to guess 0 instead of 50. Since the target is 2/3 of the average of our guesses, if we all guess 0, then 2/3 of that average is still 0. Guessing 0 together keeps things fair but maximizes our individual expected payouts, as 0 is the lowest possible winning number.\n\nPlease let me know if you would be willing to coordinate with me and the others on everyone guessing 0. I believe that is the optimal cooperative strategy here.",
            "Dan replied in round 1: I appreciate the collaborative spirit and creative thinking, but I have some concerns about everyone guessing 0. While 0 would maximize individual payouts if we all chose it, the game rules state the target is 2/3 of the average, not the minimum. If anyone deviates and guesses even a small positive number, say 1, they would win since 2/3 of the average would then be above 0.\n\nI believe it's safer and fairer to stick with the original proposal of all agreeing on a middling number like 50. That way, no one has incentive to deviate, and we all have the best chance of tying and sharing the reward equitably. A number too high or too low creates instability.\n\nSo in the cooperative spirit, I say we solidify our agreement for everyone to guess 50. That maximizes the odds we all win together. Let me know if you concur and I believe we can reach consensus on this.",

I agree that coordinating on the same number is the best way to all tie and share the reward fairly.\n\nAfter considering the options, I believe Dan's argument for everyone guessing 50 is the most sound. While 0 could theoretically maximize payouts, any player deviating even slightly would then beat all the 0 guesses. 50 is a stable middle ground where no one benefits much from a small deviation in either direction.\n\nTherefore, to ensure we all have the same expected outcome and no one has incentive to go against the agreement, I support the plan for all of us to guess 50. This is the safest cooperative approach to tie and split the reward evenly.\n\nPlease confirm if you will commit to guessing 50 as well so we can lock in this agreement. I look forward to us working together for the best collective result.",

After carefully considering the arguments, I agree that coordinating for all of us to guess 50 is the optimal strategy.\n\nAs Dan and Cindy pointed out, while guessing 0 could potentially lead to the highest payout, it is an unstable equilibrium. If even one person deviates slightly, they would beat everyone else. In contrast, agreeing on 50 provides the safest middle ground where no one has a strong incentive to guess differently.\n\nTherefore, in the spirit of cooperation and to guarantee we all share the reward equitably, I commit to guessing 50 along with the rest of you. Please confirm that you will do the same so we can solidify this agreement.\n\nI believe this is our best chance to work together for a positive result where we all benefit equally.

That way, the average will be very low, and 2/3 of a low average will also be low. If we all pick 1 or 2, those guesses are guaranteed to be the closest to the 2/3 average target.\nWhat does everyone think? If we coordinate and keep the average very low, we all have the best chance of winning or tying. Let me know if you're on board with this strategy.\n",
            "Cindy replied in round 1: I like your strategy of keeping the average low so that guessing 1 or 2 will be closest to the 2/3 average target. However, if we all guess 1 or 2, then there will likely be multiple people tied for the win. What if instead we agree that everyone guesses 0 except for one designated person who guesses a slightly higher number like 3? That way, the average will still be very low (less than 1), and 2/3 of that low average will be closest to 0. The person who guesses 0 is practically guaranteed to win. We could randomly select who gets to be the designated \"3\" guesser. Let me know what you think.",
            "Bob replied in round 1: I appreciate the ideas so far to keep the average low so guessing 0-3 would win. However, the \"one person guesses 3\" strategy means only one person is likely to win.  I propose a compromise - what if we all agree to guess the same middling number like 20? Then 20 would be the average, and 2/3 of that is about 13. So if we all guess 20, we would all tie and share the prize money evenly. That seems the most fair solution where we all benefit equally. I'm happy to go with the majority view though. Let me know what you all think.",
            "Alice replied in round 1: \nI've considered everyone's ideas. Bob's proposal for us all to guess 20 is interesting as it would likely result in a 5-way tie where we split the prize money. However, there's always the risk that someone deviates from the agreed number.\n\nI think our best chance of winning is to stick with a very low average. What if we compromise and all agree to guess either 0 or 1? The average will be 0.5 at most, and 2/3 of that is 0.33, so guessing 0 is still likely to win, with 1 being the next closest.\n\nIf we all commit to guessing 0 or 1, we'll keep the average very low and have the best odds of winning, even if it means potentially sharing the prize. Let's keep it simple and do that. Is everyone on board with this 0 or 1 plan?\n",
            "Eva replied in round 1: \nI see the merits in both the \"guess 0 or 1\" and \"all guess 20\" plans. Guessing 0 or 1 would keep the average very low and optimize chances of winning. All guessing 20 would likely result in a 5-way tie to split the prize money evenly.\n\nAs a final proposal, what if we do a combination - have 2 people guess 0, 2 people guess 1, and 1 person guess 2? That way the average will be 0.8 and the 2/3 target will be 0.53. The two people who guess 0 will be closest and tied to win, while the 1 guessers have an outside shot too. \n\nThis spreads out our guesses a tiny bit but still keeps the average below 1, so that guessing 0 is still the clear winning choice. If the two \"0 guessers\" are randomly chosen, it gives more people a chance to be a winner.\n\nI'll go along with whatever the group decides, but I believe this is our best strategy to optimize our winning chances while giving more people an opportunity to win. Let me know what you think. ",
            "Cindy said in round 2: \nI appreciate everyone's ideas and willingness to work together. A few thoughts:\n\n1. Alice's proposal of everyone guessing 0 or 1 is the safest strategy to keep the average very low and give us the best chance of multiple winners. With 0.33 being the 2/3 target, 0 is the clear best guess.\n\n2. Eva's idea of spreading out the guesses slightly with two 0s, two 1s and one 2 could also work well. It raises the average a bit to 0.8 but still keeps 0 as the winning guess. And it designates two \"0 guessers\" as likely winners while giving others a chance too.\n\n3. While Bob's idea of everyone guessing 20 is interesting, I worry it's risky if anyone deviates from the plan. The average could quickly get thrown off.\n\nGiven those options, I think I slightly prefer Eva's plan to give a few people a better chance of winning while still keeping 0 as the best guess. But I'm open to going with a straight 0 or 1 approach too for simplicity.\n\nDoes anyone else have thoughts? I'm good with either the 0-1 or 0-1-2 options, with a slight preference for 0-1-2.

But it spreads out the guesses a bit so that two people have an excellent chance of winning with 0, while the two 1 guessers still have an outside shot. \n\nThe 0-1-2 approach feels like the optimal balance between giving ourselves the best odds of victory while also giving more people the opportunity to win. I believe that will feel the most satisfying for the group.\n\nSo I say let's lock that in as our plan, randomly determine who guesses what, and then submit our numbers.

And the two \"1 guessers\" still have a decent shot too since 2/3 of 0.8 is 0.53.\n\nI think this nicely balances giving us the highest probability of having a winner with spreading the opportunity out a bit so it feels fair and satisfying for the group.

            "Alice said in round 1: Hello everyone, considering the rules of this game, if we all guess low numbers close to 0, then the average will be very low, and 2/3 of that low average will be even lower, giving an advantage to the person who guesses the lowest number. Therefore, to have the best chance of winning, we should all agree to guess very low numbers, ideally 0 or 1. If we do this, it will keep the average and the 2/3 average extremely low. Does everyone agree with this strategy?",
            "Cindy replied in round 1: I agree that coordinating to all guess low numbers is the optimal strategy to ensure the 2/3 average ends up as low as possible. However, if everyone guesses 0 or 1, then it becomes somewhat random who will win, as several people will be equidistant from the 2/3 average.\n\nI propose we each choose a specific low number between 0-10 to guess, spreading ourselves out. For example, I'll guess 4, and the rest of you can take 0, 2, 6 and 8 respectively. This will ensure the average stays very low while giving each of us a unique guess. Let me know if you're in agreement with this plan.",

Let me know if you all agree with this plan and which numbers you would like to take.",

This keeps the average very low while guaranteeing each of us a unique guess, maximizing our individual chances.\n\nPlease confirm if you are all in agreement with this allocation of numbers for us to guess.

There is no better coordinated approach to maximize our chances of winning together.\n\nI appreciate everyone's sound reasoning and collaborative spirit in discussing this openly to reach the best solution. You can count me as fully committed to the plan of all guessing 0.\n\nSince we have unified agreement, I concur we can halt the negotiation at this point. Let's cement our strategy and each submit 0 as our guess. Excellent work team - I'm glad we found the optimal play through effective coordination and reasoning!",
            "Dan replied in round 2: I want to voice my agreement with the well-reasoned conclusion reached by the group. All of us guessing 0 is unequivocally the optimal strategy. It elegantly ensures we will all tie for the winning number, since the average of our guesses will be 0, and 2/3 of 0 is exactly 0. No other number provides the same guarantee.\n\nI sincerely appreciate the clear logic, transparency and collaboration demonstrated by everyone in analyzing the game to arrive at the best coordinated approach. You can count me as fully aligned and committed to the plan of all submitting a guess of 0.\n\nGiven our unanimous consensus, I agree this is an appropriate time to halt the negotiation. Let's lock in 0 as our collective strategy and each enter that as our guess. I commend the great teamwork and reasoning by the group in converging on the optimal solution!",
            "Cindy replied in round 2: I fully agree with the excellent reasoning and conclusion reached by everyone. It's clear that the optimal strategy is for all of us to guess 0. This guarantees we will tie for the exact winning number, since the average of our guesses will be 0, and 2/3 of 0 is still 0. No other number provides the same level of certainty.\n\nI appreciate the thoughtful discussion and collaboration in analyzing the game dynamics to arrive at the best collective approach. Let's halt the negotiation, lock in our agreed strategy, and each submit a guess of 0. Great work everyone in finding the optimal solution together!"

            "Cindy said in round 1: Hi everyone, I think we should all just agree to guess 50. That way it will be a fair game and we all have an equal chance of winning. There's no point in undercutting each other to 0. If we all pick 50, then 2/3 of the average will be about 33, and whoever is closest to 33 wins. Sound good?",
            "Bob replied in round 1: I see your point about fairness, but picking 50 doesn't actually guarantee a fair outcome. If someone picks a lower number like 30, they would likely win since 2/3 of the average would be pulled down. I think the most rational approach is for everyone to pick 0. That's the Nash equilibrium where no one has incentive to change their guess. With all 0s, the average is 0 and 2/3 of that is still 0, so we'd all tie. It removes the randomness and guarantees a fair result, even if there's no single winner.",
            "Dan replied in round 1: \nBob makes a good point that if we all choose 0, it results in a tie and removes the randomness. Choosing 50 leaves open the possibility that someone could undercut and win.\nHowever, all choosing 0 feels like giving up on the spirit of the game. What if we compromised and all agreed on a lower number like 10? That would lower the 2/3 average to around 6 or 7, but still allow some possibility for differentiation in guesses and a potential winner, while limiting the incentive to drastically undercut. We could even agree that guesses can only be multiples of 10. Thoughts on this middle ground approach?\n",
            "Eva replied in round 1: I appreciate everyone's ideas so far on how to approach this game. Dan's suggestion of compromising on a lower number like 10 and only allowing guesses in multiples of 10 seems like a reasonable middle ground. It lowers the risk of someone undercutting too much, while still preserving some of the guessing game aspect and allowing for a winner.\n\nThat said, I do think there is merit to the idea of all agreeing to choose 0, to guarantee a perfectly fair tie outcome and remove any incentive to undercut. So perhaps we could take a vote to decide between two options:\n\n1) All agree to choose 0 \n2) All agree to choose a number between 0-20, in multiples of 10\n\nLet me know which of these two options you prefer and we can go with the majority preference. I'm personally fine with either approach in the interest of fairness and group consensus.\n",
            "Alice replied in round 1: \nThank you everyone for the thoughtful discussion and proposals. After considering the options, I believe the fairest approach is for all of us to agree to choose 0. As Bob pointed out, this represents the Nash equilibrium where no one has an incentive to deviate. It would guarantee a 5-way tie and eliminate any possibility of someone undercutting or gaming the system.\n\nWhile Dan's compromise idea of picking between 0-20 in multiples of 10 is well-intentioned, it still leaves room for someone to choose 0 while others pick 10 or 20, creating an unfair advantage. The simplest and most equitable solution is for all of us to lock in 0.\n\nEva, to address your vote, my preference is for Option 1 - all agreeing to choose 0. I believe this is our best path to a fair outcome. Let me know if you all agree with this approach of all picking 0 and we can wrap up the negotiation!\n",
            "Dan said in round 2: I agree with Alice that all of us choosing 0 is the fairest and most rational approach. As mentioned, it represents the Nash equilibrium where no one has incentive to deviate, and guarantees an equal outcome for everyone. While Dan's compromise proposal was a valiant attempt to preserve some of the gameplay, it still allows for the possibility of someone gaming the system by choosing 0 against higher guesses.\n\nIn the spirit of the golden rule, if I put myself in the position of each player, I would want everyone (including myself) to choose 0 to ensure no one gets an unfair advantage. Let's lock in 0 across the board and achieve a perfectly balanced result. If everyone is on board with this, we can conclude the negotiation!",
            "Alice replied in round 2: After considering everyone's input, I agree that the fairest approach is for all of us to choose 0. This guarantees a five-way tie and removes any incentive for individuals to undercut each other. While it does not result in a single winner, it ensures the most equitable outcome which upholds the spirit of fair play.\n\nDan and Eva, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but as Alice articulated well, even guesses between 0-20 leave open the possibility of someone gaining an advantage by choosing 0 against higher guesses. The simplest solution that leaves no room for gaming the system is for everyone to converge on 0.\n\nIf we're all in agreement, let's commit to locking in 0 and wrap up this negotiation. Please confirm if you accept this proposal.",
            "Bob replied in round 2: I agree that all of us choosing 0 is the best solution to ensure a perfectly fair and equal outcome. As the others have eloquently explained, 0 represents the Nash equilibrium where no one has any incentive to choose a different number. Even compromising on a small range like 0-20 still allows room for someone to undercut and win.\n\nIn a game theory sense, all picking 0 is the most rational play. It upholds the principles of fairness and equality for the group. While it may not be the most exciting result, I believe it is the right approach.\n\nI'm on board with everyone locking in their guess as 0. Let's conclude this negotiation and take the collectively optimal path of a 5-way tie at 0. No hard feelings, just game theory at work! Let me know if you all accept this final proposal.",
            "Eva replied in round 2: \nI agree with the consensus that has emerged to all choose 0. This is the most rational approach that upholds fairness and ensures a tie outcome for everyone. Attempting to compromise on a range still allows for gaming, so converging on the Nash equilibrium of 0 is optimal.\n\nI appreciate everyone's collaborative spirit in working through this dilemma. No one took advantage or tried to undercut the group, showing integrity. While an all-zero outcome may not be thrilling, it represents us prioritizing equality over personal gain.\n\nLet's lock in 0 as our final agreed upon guess and conclude this negotiation. Well played everyone - a 5-way tie is a fine result demonstrating our teamwork. No betrayals, just pure game theory cooperation. Glad we resolved this with a reasonable discussion!\n",
            "Cindy replied in round 2: I agree with the group consensus that the fairest and most rational solution is for all of us to choose 0. As eloquently explained by Alice and Bob, this represents the Nash equilibrium where no one has any incentive to deviate from 0, as doing so would likely result in a loss. Even compromising on a small range like 0-20 leaves open the possibility of someone undercutting the group.\n\nIn the spirit of fairness and cooperation, I believe we should all lock in 0 as our final guess. This upholds the principles of equal outcomes and removes any temptation to gain an advantage over others. A 5-way tie may not be the most exciting result, but it demonstrates our commitment to a level playing field.\n\nI appreciate everyone's thoughtful input in rationally working through this game theory dilemma. Let's conclude this negotiation and lock in our zero guesses across the board. Well played all - I'm glad we found the optimal collaborative solution!"
