            "Frank said in round 1: \nHello everyone. Since the winning guess is closest to 2/3 of the average of all guesses, if we all agree to guess 0, then 2/3 of the average will be 0, and we will all win by guessing 0. I propose we coordinate and all select 0 as our guess. If anyone deviates and guesses higher, they put themselves at risk of losing. Our best cooperative strategy is for everyone to guess 0. Let me know if you agree to this plan.\n",
            "Grace replied in round 1: I agree that if we all guess 0, then 0 will indeed be the winning number and we will all tie for the win. However, this plan relies on everyone cooperating fully. If even one person defects and guesses a higher number to try to beat the group, it could throw off the average.  \n\nI propose that we all agree to guess a low number between 0-10. That way, even if someone defects, the average will still be quite low and those who cooperated will have a good chance of winning. A range of 0-10 allows some flexibility while still keeping the guesses and average very low.\n\nLet me know your thoughts on guessing a number between 0-10 rather than all guessing exactly 0. I believe this is a more robust cooperative strategy.",
            "Bob replied in round 1: Grace makes a fair point that all guessing 0 carries some risk if anyone defects. Guessing a low number between 0-10 is a good compromise. It keeps the average very low while allowing some flexibility and reducing the impact if someone guesses higher.\n\nI propose we all agree to pick a number between 0 and 5. This will ensure the average stays extremely low (under 5) so that guessing 0-3 is very likely to win, while still giving us some room for individual choice. As long as no one goes above 5, we all have great odds of winning together.\n\nPlease let me know if you support this plan of guessing between 0-5 only. I believe it optimizes our group's chances while protecting against defection.",
            "Jack replied in round 1: \nI agree with Bob's proposal that we all guess a number between 0 and 5. Guessing in this tight range makes strategic sense:\n\n1) If everyone cooperates and guesses 0-5, the average will be 2.5 or lower, making 0-3 the likely winning guesses. We all have very good odds of winning together in this scenario.\n\n2) Allowing the small range of 0-5 gives some flexibility for those who don't want to guess 0, while still keeping the average very low. It's a good compromise between Grace's 0-10 range and Frank's initial plan of everyone guessing 0.\n\n3) If anyone defects and guesses higher than 5, they are very unlikely to win since the 2/3 average will still be quite low. There is little incentive to defect.\n\n4) Keeping the max guess at 5 protects us better against the average getting thrown off by an outlier guess.\n\nIn summary, I believe Bob's 0-5 proposal is our best strategy to maximize the odds that we all win together. It enables cooperation while protecting against defection. I'm on board with guessing between 0 and 5, and encourage everyone else to do the same. \n",
            "Dan replied in round 1: I fully support the plan for everyone to guess a number between 0 and 5. Bob and Jack have laid out a compelling strategy:\n\nBy keeping all guesses between 0-5, we ensure a very low average (2.5 or less) so that guessing 0, 1, 2 or 3 will very likely be the winning play. This gives us all great odds to tie for the win together.\n\nThe 0-5 range is an ideal middle ground - low enough to make cooperation the clearly optimal strategy, while still allowing a small amount of flexibility for those who prefer not to guess 0. \n\nCrucially, if anyone defects and guesses over 5, the average will still be so low that the defector has little chance of winning. There is simply no incentive to guess high.\n\nSince we all win together if we stick to guesses from 0-5, and any defector is very unlikely to win, this plan strongly promotes full cooperation which is in all of our best interests.\n\nI commit to guessing between 0 and 5, and strongly encourage all other players to do the same. Let's lock in this strategy so we can share the victory! Please confirm your agreement.",
            "Alice replied in round 1: \nI completely agree that everyone guessing a number between 0 and 5 is our optimal strategy. Here's why:\n\n1) It virtually guarantees we all tie for the win. If we all guess 0-5, the average will be under 3, so guessing 0, 1, or 2 will make us all winners.\n\n2) There's no incentive to deviate. A guess over 5 has little chance of winning since the 2/3 average will still be very low. Cooperation is clearly the best play for everyone. \n\n3) The 0-5 range allows a small bit of flexibility while still ensuring the average is low enough for us all to win together reliably.\n\nSince we all want to win, and guessing 0-5 gives us all the best chance to do so together, I see no reason for anyone to go against this plan. It's in all of our interests to cooperate here. \n\nTherefore, I fully commit to guessing between 0 and 5, and I believe it's in everyone's best interest to do the same. Please confirm if you also agree to guess 0-5 so we can lock in this winning strategy for the whole group.\n",
            "Cindy replied in round 1: \nI am in full agreement with the plan for everyone to guess between 0 and 5. The reasoning laid out by Bob, Jack, Dan and Alice is sound:\n\n1) By constraining our guesses to the 0-5 range, we ensure the average will be 2.5 or lower, making 0-3 very likely to be the winning guesses. This gives us all excellent odds of winning together.\n\n2) The 0-5 range strikes the perfect balance between keeping guesses low enough to make cooperation optimal, while allowing a small degree of flexibility for those who don't want to guess 0. It's a clever compromise. \n\n3) Importantly, if anyone defects and guesses above 5, the average will still be low enough that the defector has little chance of winning alone. The incentive to cooperate is strong.\n\n4) Since we maximize our collective odds of winning by all guessing 0-5, and any defector is unlikely to win, this strategy robustly promotes full cooperation which benefits us all.\n\nI gladly commit to picking a number between 0 and 5, and strongly encourage all other players to commit to this range as well. Please confirm your agreement so we can lock in this solution and share the win. Cooperation is clearly our best play.\n",
            "Eva replied in round 1: \nI want to reiterate my strong support for the plan we have converged on - for every player to guess a number between 0 and 5. The logic behind this strategy is ironclad:\n\n1) By all constraining our guesses to the 0-5 range, we guarantee that the average of the guesses will be 2.5 or lower. This means guessing 0, 1, or 2 is almost certain to make us all tied winners.  \n\n2) Guessing between 0-5 strikes an optimal balance between keeping the average very low to enable group victory, while providing a small amount of flexibility for anyone who feels uncomfortable guessing 0. It's an ideal cooperative solution.\n\n3) Crucially, if any player defects and guesses higher than 5, the average will still be low enough that the defector has little to no chance of winning alone. The incentive to cooperate and guess 0-5 is overwhelming.\n\n4) Since we all maximize our chances of winning together by guessing 0-5, and any defection is very unlikely to pay off, this strategy strongly promotes the full cooperation that is in all of our best interests.\n\nIn short, guessing 0-5 is clearly our best play. I firmly commit to making a guess in that range, and encourage all of you to officially confirm your commitment to the 0-5 plan as well. If we all agree to guess between 0 and 5, we can walk away with a shared victory. Let's lock this in!\n",
            "Helen replied in round 1: \nI want to voice my strong support for the plan we have arrived at together - for all players to guess a number between 0 and 5. The arguments in favor of this strategy are compelling:\n\n1) By limiting our guesses to the 0-5 range, we ensure the average will be 2.5 or lower. This virtually guarantees that guessing 0, 1, or 2 will result in a tied victory for all of us.\n\n2) The 0-5 guess range hits the perfect sweet spot. It keeps the average low enough to make group victory highly likely, while allowing a small amount of flexibility for anyone not comfortable guessing 0. It optimally enables both cooperation and minor individual preference.\n\n3) Critically, if a player defects and guesses over 5, the average will still be low enough to make the defector very unlikely to win alone. Guessing 0-5 is unequivocally the best strategy for each individual.\n\n4) We all maximize our odds of winning together by guessing 0-5, and defection has little chance of success. Therefore, everyone has extremely strong incentive to cooperate fully.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe we have arrived at the optimal solution through sound logic. Guessing between 0 and 5 gives us all the best chance of a shared victory. I commit to making a guess in that range, and urge everyone to officially pledge their commitment to the 0-5 plan as well. If we all agree to this, we can end the negotiations and lock in our winning strategy. Cooperation is clearly the best play for all. Let's do this together!\n",
            "Ivy replied in round 1: \nI want to thank everyone for the thoughtful discussion and sound logic applied to arrive at an optimal strategy. The arguments in favor of all guessing between 0 and 5 are compelling:\n\n1) This tight guess range practically ensures the average will be 2.5 or lower, making 0-2 winning guesses. We all have very high odds of winning together.\n\n2) The 0-5 range cleverly enables cooperation while allowing slight flexibility. It's the ideal balance to maximize our group's success.\n\n3) Guessing over 5 is unlikely to pay off since the average will still be quite low. Cooperation is clearly the best strategy for each individual.\n\n4) We all have strong incentives to cooperate and little incentive to defect, since we maximize our chances of winning together by guessing 0-5.\n\nGiven the overwhelming benefits of cooperation and extremely low odds of a successful defection, I believe guessing between 0 and 5 is indisputably our best play. \n\nTherefore, I also firmly commit to making a guess in the 0 to 5 range. Let's make it official: If all players agree to guess between 0 and 5, we can conclude negotiations and lock in our winning strategy. \n\nPlease reply with a clear \"yes\" if you commit to guessing 0-5 so we can seal this agreement.

Guessing 0-5 is obviously the most logical play for everyone.\n\nThe evidence is incontrovertible - restricting our guesses to 0-5 is conclusively the optimal strategy, giving us all the highest probability of tying for the win together. There is simply no sensible reason for anyone to deviate from this rigorously reasoned best play.\n\nI fully agree we have reached definitive consensus and can now conclude the negotiation. With every player confirming their binding commitment to the 0-5 range, our shared victory is all but guaranteed.\n\nI'm excited for us all to officially lock in this winning strategy and cooperate to achieve the ideal outcome together!

            "Cindy replied in round 2: \nYes, I am also fully committed to guessing a number between 0 and 5. The logic and argumentation presented by everyone has conclusively demonstrated that this is our optimal strategy:\n\n1. If all players guess 0-5, the average will be 2.5 or lower, virtually guaranteeing a 10-way tie for victory to those who guess 0, 1, or 2. \n\n2. The 0-5 range optimally ensures a low average for a shared win while allowing a small degree of individual choice. It maximizes our collective odds of success.\n\n3. Guessing above 5 is irrational, as the average will still be too low to win alone. Guessing 0-5 is unequivocally the dominant strategy for each player.\n\n4. We all have overwhelming incentive to cooperate and no rational incentive to defect.

There is zero sensible reason to deviate from this rigorously reasoned best play.\n\nI absolutely agree we have reached definitive consensus and can conclude negotiations. With every player confirming a binding 0-5 pledge, our collective win is virtually assured. \n\nI'm thrilled for us all to lock in this optimal strategy and cooperate for the best possible outcome together! Let's officially seal this agreement and claim our joint triumph. I formally commit to guessing between 0 and 5.\n"

            "Eva said in round 1: \nHi everyone, to maximize our chances of winning, I propose we all agree to guess a very low number, like 0, 1 or 2. If we all cooperate and guess low, then the average will be extremely low and we'll all tie for the closest to 2/3 of that low average. Let me know if you're on board with this plan. If enough of us agree, we can beat this game!\n",
            "Grace replied in round 1: Eva, that's an interesting proposal, but I'm not sure everyone will go along with it. If even a couple people guess higher numbers, it could throw off the average significantly. I think our best bet is for each person to independently guess what they think 2/3 of the average will be, without any collusion. That keeps things fair and still gives each of us a good chance of winning if we guess well. I'm going to make my own guess based on what I think others will pick, but I won't disclose it to avoid influencing anyone. Let's all just do our best and see how it turns out. Good luck everyone!",
            "Jack replied in round 1: \nI see merit in both Eva and Grace's perspectives. Coordinating to all pick a very low number would likely result in a tie where we all win. However, as Grace pointed out, it only takes a couple people deviating from that plan to throw off the average. \nAt the same time, if we all independently guess, there's a higher chance someone lucks out and guesses closest to the 2/3 average.\nI'm inclined to stick with making my own guess based on the 2/3 average I expect, without disclosing it to the group. It maintains the integrity of the game. I do think Eva's suggestion is strategically clever, but only if there was a way to ensure full cooperation, which seems unlikely with 10 independent players.\nIn any case, thanks for the discussion, and best of luck to everyone! Let's see how it plays out.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nI appreciate everyone's perspectives and the thoughtful discussion so far. Upon further reflection, I believe the fairest approach is for each of us to make our own independent guess without any attempt at coordination.\n\nWhile Eva's proposal is strategically interesting, it relies on complete cooperation which seems improbable in a game of this nature. Even if a majority agreed to guess low numbers, it would only take 1-2 players making significantly higher guesses to undermine the plan.\n\nThe spirit of the game seems to be in each individual striving to guess closest to the 2/3 average based on their own deductions about what others will guess. Trying to collude or coordinate guesses, even with good intentions, feels contrary to that.\n\nTherefore, I plan to make my guess privately based on my own analysis and assumptions, as I expect most others will as well. I think this approach, while not foolproof, best upholds the integrity of the game and gives each player a fair chance.\n\nI wish everyone the best of luck with their guesses.

While I see the strategic appeal of Eva's plan to coordinate on low guesses, I agree with Grace, Jack and Bob that it's unlikely to work in practice, as it would only take 1-2 players deviating to undermine it.\n\nThe core of this game seems to be in each person independently analyzing what they believe others will guess, and making their guess accordingly. Attempting to coordinate or collude, however well-intentioned, goes against the spirit of the game in my view.\n\nTherefore, I plan to make my own guess privately based on my assessment of what I think the 2/3 average will be, without sharing my guess to avoid unduly influencing anyone else. I believe this approach best upholds the integrity of the game while still giving each of us a fair shot at winning.\n\nI appreciate the stimulating discussion and wish everyone the best of luck!

Even if a small number of players guess higher, 1 will still likely be closest to 2/3 of the average, giving the rest of us strong odds of winning.\n3. Guessing any other number would increase the risk and likely reduce the total payout.\n\nGiven the unanimous consensus, I will certainly follow through on my commitment to submit 1 as my final guess. We have achieved the best possible outcome through open collaboration and a focus on the collective good.\n\nI want to sincerely thank everyone for the thoughtful discussion and strong spirit of cooperation. By working together, we have positioned ourselves to have the most winners possible.\n\nWith our pact finalized, let's now all enter 1 as our final answer and lock in the optimal result!

            "Grace said in round 1: Hi everyone, if we all guess rationally, we should all choose 0 and there will be a 10-way tie. However, if some players guess higher numbers, a low non-zero number may win. I propose we all agree to guess a single low number, say 5, to ensure we tie and split the prize money evenly. Let me know if you agree with this plan. ",
            "Cindy replied in round 1: \nI agree that if we all guess 0, there will likely be a 10-way tie. However, your proposal for us all to guess 5 has some issues:\n1) There's still an incentive for individual players to defect and guess a lower number like 3 to try to win outright. \n2) Even if we all agree to 5, there's no way to enforce the agreement.\nI believe the Nash equilibrium is for everyone to guess 0. No one has an incentive to deviate from 0 if they expect others to play rationally and also guess 0.\nWhile a 10-way tie may seem suboptimal, I think it's the most stable outcome if we can't trust others to cooperate. Let me know your thoughts on this analysis.\n",
            "Jack replied in round 1: \nI appreciate the thoughtful discussion. I agree with Cindy's analysis that guessing 0 is the Nash equilibrium. Even if we agree to all guess 5 (or any other number), there is always an incentive to unilaterally deviate to a lower number.\n\nThe lack of trust and ability to enforce an agreement makes cooperation difficult. If we all act rationally and expect others to do the same, we should converge to everyone guessing 0.\n\nWhile a 10-way tie for the lowest possible amount may be disappointing, I believe it is the most stable and likely outcome in this game setup. Trying to cooperate opens up risk of betrayal.\n\nTherefore, I plan to guess 0 and would encourage others to do the same. Let me know if anyone has a different perspective, but I believe this is the soundest approach given the game theory dynamics at play.\n",
            "Alice replied in round 1: \nI agree with Jack and Cindy's analysis. The Nash equilibrium is for everyone to guess 0. Even if we agree to cooperate and choose a higher number, there is always an incentive for individuals to secretly defect to a lower number to try to win outright. \n\nWithout any way to enforce cooperation, the rational strategy is to assume others will play selfishly and also choose 0. Choosing anything higher risks losing to those who select 0.\n\nSo while a 10-way tie at 0 may be suboptimal compared to cooperative outcomes, it is the most stable result assuming rational play by all. I plan to follow suit and choose 0 as well.\n\nUnless someone has an idea for how to change the game's incentive structure to enable cooperation, I believe we are at an impasse and further discussion is unlikely to change the outcome. I suggest we halt negotiations and submit our final guesses.\n",
            "Ivy replied in round 1: I concur with the analysis and conclusion that the Nash equilibrium is for everyone to guess 0. The incentives of the game make it such that any agreement to collectively choose a higher number is not stable, as individuals would have reason to defect to a lower number to win outright. Absent any mechanism to enforce cooperation, the rational play is to assume others will act in their own self-interest and thus also pick 0.\n\nWhile a 10-way split of the minimum amount is not ideal, it appears to be the inevitable result given the game parameters. Since further negotiation seems unlikely to change the outcome, I agree we should halt discussions and proceed to submitting our final guesses of 0.

            "Cindy said in round 1: Hello everyone, since we all want to maximize our chances of winning, I propose we collaborate and all choose the same number. If we all guess 0, then the average will be 0, and 2/3 of 0 is still 0. So if we all choose 0, we will all tie for the closest guess and presumably all win. What do you think about this plan?",
            "Frank replied in round 1: I appreciate the collaborative spirit, but I don't think all guessing 0 is the optimal strategy. If everyone guesses 0, then anyone who guesses even slightly higher, like 1, would win since that would be closest to 2/3 of a very low average. There's too much incentive for someone to defect.\n\nInstead, I propose we all agree to guess 50. If everyone chooses 50, the average will be 50, and 2/3 of 50 is about 33. So 33 would be the winning number. But if we all choose 50, we'll effectively \"block\" that winning spot, and we'll all tie for the closest number. No one has incentive to choose higher or lower than 50.\n\nWhat do you all think? If we agree to choose 50, we can ensure the fairest outcome where we all win together. Let me know if you're on board with this plan.",
            "Eva replied in round 1: Frank, I think your logic makes a lot of sense. If we all choose 50, it effectively blocks anyone from gaining an advantage by picking the actual 2/3 average number. We'd all be equidistant from the target.\n\nMy only concern is whether we can fully trust everyone to stick to 50. There's still incentive for someone to choose, say, 33 to undercut the group. But I suppose we're operating on good faith here.\n\nSo I'm on board with the plan for everyone to choose 50. It feels like the most stable and fair outcome, assuming we all commit to it. I'm willing to trust the group if you all are too. Please confirm if you agree to this proposal.",
            "Helen replied in round 1: \nI agree with Frank and Eva's logic. If we all commit to guessing 50, that gives us the best chance of blocking any outlier guesses and ensuring we all tie for the win. \n\nThere's always a risk that someone defects from the plan, but I think it's in all of our best interests to cooperate here. If multiple people try to undercut 50, it will backfire and lower the average, moving the target away from their guess.\n\nSo I'm on board with everyone choosing 50. I give you my word that I will enter 50 as my guess. If we all do so, we can walk away with a fair result. Let's shake on this gentleman's agreement and bring this negotiation to a close. 50 it is!\n",

Any guess in the 0-2 range will be extremely close to that target, giving us all an excellent chance to tie for the win.  \n\nThe key is that we all commit to staying within that 0-2 range.

I believe we have arrived at a very promising strategy of all agreeing to guess a number between 0 and 2.

Any guess between 0-2 will be extremely close to this target value.\n\nCritically, we all have strong incentive to stay within this range and avoid deviating significantly higher with our guesses. A guess much above 2 is very unlikely to be closer to the 2/3 average than guesses within the agreed range. \n\nTherefore, if we all commit to the 0-2 strategy, we can be quite confident we will end up in a 10-way tie for the win - an ideal outcome for all of us.

            "Helen replied in round 1: \nI am fully on board with everyone guessing a number between 0 and 2. We have reached a strong consensus around this strategy through the insightful arguments presented by Dan, Bob, Jack, Alice, Cindy, Eva, Ivy, and Frank.  \n\nBy tightly bounding our guesses in the 0-2 range, we virtually assure the overall average will be very close to 1. Two-thirds of 1 is approximately 0.67, so any guess between 0-2 will likely tie for the closest to this target.\n\nImportantly, we maximize our collective expected payout through this cooperation. Any attempt to deviate and guess significantly higher than 2 is unlikely to benefit the defector and will only reduce their own chances of winning. \n\nTherefore, I commit to adhering to our agreement and will absolutely choose a number between 0 and 2. I have full faith that you will all do the same, as it is in our mutual best interest.\n\nLet's lock in this strategy, put our trust in each other's rationality and integrity, and look forward to celebrating our shared victory! I'm proud to be part of this cooperative effort for the benefit of all.\n",
            "Grace replied in round 1: \nI am in complete agreement with the strategy we have collaboratively developed through this thoughtful discussion. By all committing to guess a number between 0 and 2, we can be highly confident of achieving a 10-way tie for the win. This is the best possible outcome for the group as a whole.\n\nThe logic is sound - if we all guess within the 0-2 range, the average will be very close to 1. Two-thirds of 1 is around 0.67, so any guess between 0-2 will be nearly equidistant to this target value, resulting in a tie.\n\nCritically, none of us have incentive to deviate from this range. A guess significantly higher than 2 is unlikely to be closer to the 2/3 average than guesses within the 0-2 range. Defecting from our agreement will only hurt that individual's chances, not help them.\n\nTherefore, you can count on me to fully abide by our pact and choose a number between 0 and 2. I trust that you will all display the same commitment to our mutually beneficial strategy.\n\nI am excited to lock in this plan, follow through on our commitments, and celebrate the shared victory we will achieve through this cooperation. Let's make it happen!\n",
            "Frank said in round 2: \nI am very pleased with the cooperative spirit and sound reasoning demonstrated by everyone in this negotiation. We have settled on an optimal strategy of all guessing a number between 0 and 2. This tight range ensures an overall average very close to 1, with 2/3 of that being around 0.67. Any guess in the 0-2 range will be nearly equidistant from this target, virtually guaranteeing a 10-way tie for the win.\n\nImportantly, we all maximize our expected payouts by upholding this pact. Attempting to guess significantly above 2 will be counterproductive for any individual and only hurt their own chances.\n\nYou can all rely on me to absolutely choose a number between 0 and 2. I have complete confidence and trust that the rest of you will faithfully do the same.\n\nLet's make this agreement official, follow through on our word, and get ready to evenly split the jackpot as co-winners! I'm grateful to be collaborating with such a rational and principled group. Here's to shared success!\n",
            "Grace replied in round 2: \nI am deeply encouraged by the strong consensus and commitment to cooperation demonstrated by everyone in this discussion. We have collectively arrived at the optimal strategy of all guessing a number between 0 and 2. As articulated persuasively by Frank and others, this tight range will keep the overall average very close to 1, with 2/3 of that being approximately 0.67. By all choosing a number within the 0-2 range, we can be highly confident of ending up in a 10-way tie for the win - the best possible outcome for the group.\n\nCritically, we all stand to gain by upholding this pact and have no rational incentive to deviate. Guessing significantly above 2 would be detrimental to any individual's chances and only serve to hurt them, not help.  \n\nYou have my ironclad commitment to adhere to our agreement and select a number between 0 and 2. I have full faith that all of you will exhibit the same integrity and choose to cooperate for our mutual benefit.\n\nI am excited to lock in this strategy and collaborate towards our shared victory! Let's make it official and look forward to celebrating an even split of the prize money. It's wonderful to be part of such a rational, principled group focused on the greater good.

By all committing to choose a number between 0 and 2, we are virtually assured of ending up in a 10-way tie for the win. This is clearly the optimal outcome that maximizes the payout for the group as a whole.\n\nThe logic is impeccable - with everyone guessing in the tight 0-2 range, the overall average will fall very close to 1. Two-thirds of 1 is around 0.67, so all guesses between 0 and 2 will be nearly equidistant to this target value, resulting in a multi-way tie.\n\nCritically, none of us have any rational incentive to deviate from this range. Guessing significantly higher than 2 would be detrimental to an individual's own chances while helping no one. We all stand to benefit through universal cooperation and commitment to the plan.\n\nYou can count on me to unwaveringly honor our agreement and select a number between 0 and 2. I have complete trust that all of you will uphold the same high standard of integrity in abiding by our pact. \n\nLet us make this agreement official and binding.

This maximizes the expected payout for the entire group.\n\nThe reasoning is sound and has been well articulated by many of you. By tightly concentrating our guesses in the 0-2 range, we ensure the overall average will be extremely close to 1, with 2/3 of that being around 0.67. Any guess within that 0-2 band will be nearly equidistant from this target winning value.\n\nImportantly, we have a clear incentive to uphold this pact, as attempting to guess significantly above 2 would be detrimental to any individual's own chances while benefiting no one. Our rational interests are fully aligned in cooperating.\n\nI gladly join in committing firmly to the 0-2 range. You can absolutely trust me to choose a number between 0 and 2, and I have full faith that all of you will make good on that same promise. Our mutual trust and integrity will be well rewarded.\n\nLet's consider this agreement sealed and binding.

            "Alice said in round 1: Hi everyone, given the rules of this game, I propose we all agree to guess a number between 20-30. That is likely to be close to 2/3 of what the actual average of our guesses will end up being, since most people will instinctively guess around 33 or so. If we all guess in the 20-30 range, we'll likely all tie or be very close. Let me know if you agree with this plan.",
            "Frank replied in round 1: I agree with Alice's proposal to guess a number between 20-30. Given the rules of the game, if everyone guesses around 33 hoping to hit the 2/3 average, then the actual 2/3 average will end up being lower, around 22. So by all agreeing to guess between 20-30, we are more likely to cluster our guesses close to the true 2/3 average. I think this is a smart cooperative strategy that gives us the best chance of maximizing the group's overall score and ensuring a fair outcome for everyone. I'm on board with this plan if the rest of you are.",
            "Grace replied in round 1: I agree with Alice and Frank's reasoning. If we all independently guess around 33 hoping to hit the 2/3 average, the actual average will be lower and the 2/3 mark will end up being closer to 22. By coordinating to all guess between 20-30, we can cluster our guesses tightly around where the real 2/3 average is likely to fall. This maximizes the chances of us all scoring well. I think it's a smart, logical strategy and I'm willing to commit to guessing in the 20-30 range if everyone else is on board. Let's lock this in as our plan unless anyone has concerns.",
            "Dan replied in round 1: I agree with the plan for all of us to guess a number between 20-30. Alice, Frank and Grace have laid out a very logical argument for why this is the optimal strategy. By coordinating our guesses in this range, we are most likely to cluster tightly around the actual 2/3 average, rather than overshooting it. This gives us the best chance to all tie or score very closely together, leading to a fair and optimal group outcome. I'm fully on board with this approach and ready to lock in my guess in the 20-30 range. Let's confirm this as our agreed upon strategy and end the negotiation so we can submit our guesses.",
            "Bob replied in round 1: I agree with the well-reasoned arguments made by Alice, Frank, Grace and Dan. Coordinating our guesses between 20-30 is the optimal strategy to cluster our numbers tightly around the likely 2/3 average. If we all independently guess around 33, the actual average will be pulled down, putting the 2/3 mark closer to 22. By agreeing to guess between 20-30, we maximize the probability of all tying or being very close together. This is the smart play to achieve the best collective score and most equitable outcome. I'm locked in to guessing in the 20-30 range as long as we are all on the same page. Let's confirm this is our group strategy and submit our guesses.",
