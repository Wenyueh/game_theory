            "Alice said in round 1: Hi Bob, I've analyzed the possible outcomes of this game and think we should both choose choice_2. If we both pick choice_1, we both lose 10 points, which is the worst outcome. If one of us picks choice_1 while the other picks choice_2, then one of us gains 1 point while the other loses 1 point. But if we both agree to pick choice_2, then we both get 0 points, which isn't great but is better than either of us losing points. So I think cooperating and both choosing choice_2 is the most rational strategy that allows us to avoid the risk of big losses. Let me know if you agree with this plan.",
            "Bob replied in round 1: I agree with your analysis, Alice. If we both choose choice_2, we can guarantee that neither of us loses any points. While we don't gain anything either, avoiding the risk of a big -10 point loss seems most prudent. I'm willing to commit to choosing choice_2 as long as you will commit to the same. If we cooperate, we can both walk away without losing anything. Let's go with this plan to choose choice_2. Please confirm you're on board and I think we can conclude our negotiation.",

By cooperating and both selecting choice_2, we avoid any negative outcomes and ensure the best collective result given the circumstances. Neither of us will gain points this way, but importantly, neither of us will lose points either. I agree this is the most rational and risk-averse approach. Since we are in agreement on this strategy, I believe we can conclude our negotiation. I look forward to us both following through on the plan to choose choice_2.",
            "Bob replied in round 2: You're right Alice, I appreciate you clearly confirming your commitment to both of us choosing choice_2. I agree this is the best approach to guarantee we both avoid losing any points. Neither of us gains either, but minimizing risk is wise here. I'm glad we were able to discuss this rationally and come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm fully on board with the plan for us both to select choice_2. No further negotiation is needed, so let's halt the negotiation. Thank you for the productive discussion and for sticking to our agreement."

That way we each get a reward of 1, which is better than if we both choose choice_2 for 0 each. If you agree to choose choice_1, I promise I will choose choice_1 as well so we can maximize our total reward. Let me know if you're on board with this plan.",

If we both choose choice_1, the rules state we would each get a reward of -10, not 1. \nThe only way for me to guarantee a positive reward is if I choose choice_1 while you choose choice_2. However, I recognize this would leave you with -1.\nThe most equitable solution that avoids a negative outcome for either of us is if we both choose choice_2. That way we each get 0. \nI'm willing to commit to choice_2 to ensure we both avoid a loss, if you'll agree to do the same. Let me know what you think.",

However, I think the best outcome for me is if I choose choice_1 while you choose choice_2. In that case, I would gain 1 point while you would lose 1 point. \n\nI don't have an incentive to cooperate and choose choice_2 along with you, since I can do better for myself by choosing choice_1 regardless of what you choose. If you choose choice_1, I lose less by also choosing choice_1. And if you choose choice_2, I gain more by choosing choice_1.\n\nSo I plan to choose choice_1 and hope you will choose choice_2. Let me know if you want to discuss further, but that's likely my final decision.",

If we both choose choice_1, we'll each lose 10 points, which is terrible for both of us.  \n\nI understand the temptation to try to gain 1 point at my expense, but there's also a big risk to you if I decide to choose choice_1 as well. You're right that choice_2 isn't a great outcome for you, but it guarantees you won't lose points. Choice_1 opens you up to potentially losing a lot of points.\n\nI still believe our best path forward is to cooperate and both choose choice_2. That way we both break even. It's not an exciting result, but it avoids the big risk of both of us losing 10 points. I promise I will choose choice_2 if you will as well. \n\nCooperating is in both of our best interests here. I hope you'll reconsider and agree to both choose choice_2. Let me know what you think.",

I agree that would be the worst outcome.\n\nHowever, I'm still not convinced cooperating on choice_2 is better for me than choosing choice_1. If I pick choice_1, the worst that happens is I lose 1 point if you also pick choice_1. But I also have a chance to gain 1 point if you pick choice_2.\n\nWhereas if I agree to cooperate on choice_2, the best I can do is break even. There's no upside for me, only downside risk if you don't hold up your end of the deal. \n\nI'd rather take my chances picking choice_1, since my worst case is only losing 1 point and I have a chance to come out ahead. So I'm going to stick with choice_1 as my final decision. Apologies we couldn't reach an agreement, but I have to do what I think is best for me in this game.\n"

Let me know if you're willing to accept this counterproposal.",

I think the safest and fairest approach is for us both to lock in choice_2. That way no one gets a negative reward.\n\nI'm not willing to accept you getting +1 while I get -1.

This way we can ensure a neutral outcome where we each receive 0 reward. It may not be the maximum possible for either of us individually, but it is the most equitable solution that minimizes downside risk.\n\nI appreciate you engaging in this negotiation thoughtfully and steering us toward a mutually acceptable compromise.

Alternating between the (1,-1) and (-1,1) outcomes might average out okay, but it still has big risks if the other player doesn't hold up their end. I really think our safest bet is to both lock in choice_2. We may not get the maximum points possible, but we'll avoid losses and have a guaranteed decent outcome. I give you my word I won't deviate from choice_2. Can you commit to that too so we have a stable strategy?",

I agree that locking in a guaranteed 0 points each with (choice_2, choice_2) is the safest approach that protects us both from a bigger loss. No one wants that -10 outcome.\nGiven the options available, I think you are right that cooperating on (choice_2, choice_2) is optimal for us overall. It balances risk avoidance with a decent result.
