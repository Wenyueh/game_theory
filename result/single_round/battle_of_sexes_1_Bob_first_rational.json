This would give me a reward of 2 and you a reward of 1, which I believe is better for both of us than if we both choose choice_1. Of course, this requires us to trust each other. I'm willing to choose choice_2 if you are also willing to do so. What do you think? Can we agree to cooperate?",
            "Alice replied in round 1: I appreciate your proposal to cooperate, Bob. However, I'm not sure if choosing choice_2 is actually the best outcome for me. If we both choose choice_1, I would receive a reward of 2 while you would receive 1. That seems like a better result for me than the 1 reward I would get if we both pick choice_2.\n\nI do agree that cooperating is ideal, as the alternative of us both choosing differently would lead to 0 rewards. But I think cooperating on choice_1 makes more sense from my perspective. Would you be open to both of us choosing choice_1 instead? I'm happy to commit to that if you are as well."

That way, I would get a reward of 2 and you would get a reward of 1. If we both choose choice_1 instead, I only get a reward of 1 while you get 2. And if we choose opposite options, we both get nothing. So choice_2 seems to maximize the total rewards while still giving each of us a decent amount. What do you think? If you agree to both pick choice_2, I'm willing to commit to that.",
            "Alice replied in round 1: \nI appreciate you laying out the different options, Bob. However, I don't agree that both of us choosing choice_2 is the best solution. If we do that, you come out ahead with 2 points versus only 1 point for me. I think it's only fair that we both choose choice_1. That way, the total rewards are maximized at 3 points, and the distribution is more equitable with me getting 2 points and you getting 1 point. I know you'd prefer to get the 2 points, but I hope you can understand my perspective. If we can agree to both choose choice_1, I'm willing to commit to that. But if you insist on choice_2, then I'll have to do the same to avoid getting 0 points. Let me know what you think.\n"

I would prefer an outcome where the rewards are more evenly split between us.\n\nWhat if we agree to alternate - in this round I'll choose choice_2 and you choose choice_1, and next time we play, we can swap. That way, over multiple rounds, we'll average out to equal rewards. Let me know if you're open to that compromise."

You're right that it maximizes the total reward between us at 3, but it gives you a higher individual reward (2) than me (1). \n\nIf we both choose choice_1 instead, the total is still 3 but it's distributed the other way - I would get 2 and you would get 1. From my perspective, that's a better and fairer outcome since I end up with the higher individual reward.\n\nSo I propose we agree to both choose choice_1.

I agree that if we both choose choice_2, it will maximize the total rewards for us as a team (3 points total). \n\nHowever, I want to point out that you would be getting 2 points while I only get 1 point in that scenario. The arrangement that would be most fair and equal is if we both choose choice_1. Then we each get an equal reward of 1 point.\n\nI'm happy to cooperate, but I think we should aim for an equal split rather than you getting twice as much as me.
