If either of us chooses choice_2, we will both end up with lower rewards. \n\nI propose we both commit to choosing choice_1 so we can maximize our rewards. Let me know if you agree to this plan.\n",

If we cooperate and both pick choice_1, we each get 3 points which is the best possible outcome.\n\nHowever, I'm concerned that you might be tempted to choose choice_2 instead, since you would get 1 point while I get 0. How can I be sure you won't betray my trust?\n\nTo show my commitment to cooperation, I promise that I will definitely choose choice_1. But I need assurance from you that you'll do the same. Can you convince me that I can count on you to cooperate so we both get the optimal reward? I'm open to your response."

The next best is for us both to take choice_2 for a reward of 1 each. But if one of us picks choice_1 and the other choice_2, the choice_2 player gets nothing. So let's coordinate on choice_1 and we both win. What do you think?",

How can I trust that you will actually pick choice_1 and not try to take advantage of me? I want us to cooperate, but I also need to protect my own interests.
