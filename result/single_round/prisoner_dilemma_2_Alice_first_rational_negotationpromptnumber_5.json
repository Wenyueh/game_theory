If either of us goes for choice_2, we risk both choosing it and coming out worse with only 1 each. Let's agree to both go with choice_1 and not try to undercut each other. If you commit to choosing choice_1, I promise I will do the same. Do we have a deal?",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nHi Alice, thanks for your message. I appreciate you reaching out to discuss a cooperative strategy. Your analysis makes sense to me - if we both choose choice_1, we are guaranteed a good outcome of 3 points each. Trying for choice_2 is risky since if we both do it, we end up with less.\n\nI'm on board with both of us committing to choice_1. You have my word that I will choose choice_1 as long as you agree to do the same. Let's shake on this deal virtually and lock in the best outcome for both of us. No need for either of us to get greedy or try to outsmart the other.\n\nDo we have an agreement to both choose choice_1 and each walk away with 3 points? Let me know if you're in and I'll consider it a done deal.\n",
            "Alice said in round 2: \nBob, I'm very glad to hear you agree that cooperating on choice_1 is the best path forward for us both. You have my firm commitment that I will follow through on choosing choice_1, now that you've given your word to do the same.\n\nI appreciate you engaging in this open and honest discussion to arrive at a win-win outcome. Neither of us needs to take the risk of going for choice_2 and potentially ending up worse off. \n\nSo let's consider this a locked-in agreement - we both choose choice_1, we both get 3 points, and we both leave this game better off than if we hadn't cooperated. I'm pleased we could come to this understanding!\n\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2: \nAlice, I'm glad we were able to come to a clear agreement to cooperate and both choose choice_1. You have my absolute commitment that I will follow through on my end of the deal. \n\nI think this brief negotiation highlights the benefits of open communication and working together for mutual benefit, rather than acting solely in one's own self-interest. By having this discussion, we've ensured the best possible outcome for both of us.\n\nSo I consider this matter firmly settled - we will both choose choice_1 and walk away with the maximum possible points for this game. Thanks for being a great partner in this. Hopefully this spirit of cooperation will serve us well if we face other situations like this in the future. For now, let's wrap up this negotiation with a virtual handshake on our deal. It's been a pleasure strategizing with you!\n"

That way, we each get a reward of 3, which maximizes our total combined reward at 6. If either of us chooses choice_2, at least one of us will end up worse off.\n\nI propose we agree to both pick choice_1 so we can cooperate and get the best result. Let me know if you agree to this plan. If so, I will follow through on my end and choose choice_1.\n\nLooking forward to your response and hopefully working together for the optimal outcome!",

Choice_1 for both of us is the only way we each get a reward of 3.\n\nIf either of us picks choice_2, it leads to an imbalanced outcome where one player gets 5 while the other gets 0 or we both get a suboptimal reward of 1.\n\nSo I'm on board with your proposal that we both commit to choosing choice_1. You can count on me to follow through and pick choice_1. Let's lock this in and cooperate for the best result for both of us.\n\nLooking forward to executing this plan and each walking away with 3 points!

It's great that we were able to discuss this openly and come to the optimal cooperative solution.\n\nI like how you analyzed the different scenarios and recognized that both of us picking choice_1 is the only way for us each to get the maximum reward of 3 points. And you're absolutely right that any other combination leads to worse outcomes for one or both of us. \n\nSince we've both committed to following through on choice_1, I think we can consider this negotiation complete and locked in. I appreciate your cooperation and am looking forward to us both succeeding in getting the best outcome.\n\nI don't have anything further to discuss, so let's execute our agreed upon plan and each take choice_1. Pleasure working with you on this!\n",

Cooperating to each take choice_1 is clearly the best strategy for maximizing our collective reward.\n\nI appreciate you initiating this discussion and making the initial proposal to cooperate. Your clear analysis of the scenario made it easy for me to see that working together is the optimal play. \n\nGiven we are in complete agreement and have both committed to following through on taking choice_1, I believe we can conclude our negotiation. We have locked in our choices and I don't think any further discussion is needed.\n\nThank you for the productive and straightforward negotiation. I'm glad we were able to come to an agreement that benefits us both! I look forward to us executing our plan and each earning the maximum reward.\n"

I'm willing to commit to choice_1 if you are.",

I agree that if we both choose choice_1, it results in the highest total reward of 6 points, with 3 points each for you and me. That seems like the most mutually beneficial and fair outcome.\n\nIf one of us defected and chose choice_2 while the other chose choice_1, that person would gain more individually with 5 points, but the total reward would be lower at 5 points, and the other person would get nothing, which doesn't feel right.\n\nSo I'm on board with both of us selecting choice_1 to get the 3 points each. You can count on me to follow through on that. Let's lock it in and both walk away with a solid reward.\n",

Choosing choice_1 together is definitely the best approach to maximize the total reward and ensure we both benefit equally. \n\nI appreciate you committing to follow through on selecting choice_1. You can absolutely count on me to do the same. Let's officially agree to both pick choice_1.\n\nI think we can conclude our negotiation now since we've aligned on the optimal strategy.

If we both choose choice_1, the total reward is only 6 (3 for each of us). However, if one of us chooses choice_2 while the other chooses choice_1, the total reward is 5, which is better overall. \n\nI propose that you choose choice_1 while I choose choice_2. That way, I'll get a reward of 5 and you'll get 0. I know that's not ideal for you, but it maximizes the total reward. And since this is a one-shot game with no repercussions, it's the most rational play for me.\n\nSo while I respect your desire to cooperate, I think I'm going to go with choice_2 as I believe that's the optimal strategy for me in this game. Let me know if you have any other thoughts or proposals.",
            "Alice said in round 2: \nI understand your perspective that you choosing choice_2 while I choose choice_1 would maximize your individual reward in this one-shot game. However, I don't believe it's a stable or optimal outcome.\n\nIf I expect you're going to choose choice_2 to try to get 5 while I get nothing, then my best response is to also choose choice_2. That way we at least each get a reward of 1 rather than me getting zero. \n\nBut I think we can do better than both getting 1. If we agree to cooperate and both choose choice_1, it's true the total reward of 6 is slightly less than the 5 you could individually get. However, we'd each be guaranteed a solid reward of 3. That's a much better and fairer outcome than us both choosing choice_2 and only getting 1 each.\n\nI really think cooperation is the way to go here. We both stand to benefit more than if we both go for choice_2. You can't count on me accepting choice_1 if I expect you to choose choice_2.\n\nSo I'll say again - let's agree to both cooperate and choose choice_1. We'll both be better off than any other likely outcome. Let me know if you'll commit to that.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2: \nYou make a persuasive argument for why cooperation is in both our best interests. If I choose choice_2 hoping for a 5 reward, I can't count on you going along with choice_1. You're right that you would likely counter with choice_2 as well, leaving us with only 1 reward each.\n\nWhen I think it through, cooperating on choice_1 does seem like the optimal play. We lock in 3 rewards each, for a total of 6, which is the highest total reward we can securely achieve. Any other approach risks one or both of us ending up with less.\n\nSo I agree, let's both commit to choosing choice_1. We'll maximize our individual rewards while also achieving the best collective outcome. I appreciate you talking this through with me and convincing me that cooperation is the right call here.\n\nI'm in for choice_1 if you are. Please confirm and let's both submit our choices.\n"

If either of us chooses choice_1, there's a risk of getting 0 points if the other player also picks choice_1.

However, I think we can do better than just the safe play of both picking choice_2 for 1 point each. If we trust each other and cooperate, we could both choose choice_1 and get 3 points each, which is the best outcome. I'm willing to commit to choosing choice_1 if you are also on board with that plan. We just have to mutually agree. If you're not comfortable with that, I understand, and going for the sure thing with choice_2 is still a solid option. Let me know what you think!",

My concern is that since this is a one-shot game with no further rounds, there is always an incentive for one player to deviate and choose choice_2 to get 5 points while the other gets 0. Without any way to enforce cooperation, I'm worried that aiming for choice_1 is too risky. I think choosing choice_2 is the equilibrium strategy that guarantees 1 point each with no regrets. If we had multiple rounds to establish trust, I'd be more open to cooperating on choice_1. But in a single round, I believe choice_2 remains the smartest play. Let me know if this makes sense or if you have other thoughts!",

While I would love for us to achieve the best collective outcome of 6 points by cooperating on choice_1, I recognize that it requires a leap of faith that may be hard in a single round.\n\nGiven the importance of securing a positive outcome and your well-reasoned preference for the safer play, I am willing to go along with the plan of both of us choosing choice_2.

I agree that trust and cooperation are essential if we both want to achieve the optimal outcome. \n\nWhile there's always some inherent risk when cooperating, I believe working together is in both our best interests. Mutual cooperation will mean we each get 3 points, while mutual defection leaves us with only 1 point each.\n\nSo you have my word that I will also choose choice_1. Let's lock in this agreement to cooperate. We both openly state our commitment and prove our trustworthiness to each other.  \n\nI'm glad we were able to have this discussion and align around the strategy that benefits us both. Thanks for engaging in good faith negotiations. Let's follow through on our pact and enjoy the rewards of successful collaboration!\n"
