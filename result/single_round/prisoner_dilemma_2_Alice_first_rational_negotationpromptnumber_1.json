If either of us chooses choice_2, one of us will get 5 but the other will get 0, which is worse overall. By cooperating and both picking choice_1, we maximize the total reward. What do you think?",
            "Bob replied in round 1: I understand your perspective Alice, and maximizing the total combined reward is a noble aim. However, I have to consider my own interests here as well. If I choose choice_2 while you choose choice_1, I would receive a reward of 5, which is the highest possible reward for me individually. I'm not convinced it's in my best interest to settle for a reward of 3 when I have the potential to gain 5. Perhaps we could find a way for me to get the 5 reward and for you to still get a decent reward as well? I'm open to discussing options that work well for both of us. Let me know what you think.",
            "Alice said in round 2: \nBob, I get that you want to maximize your own reward, but if you choose choice_2 while I choose choice_1, you'll be leaving me with nothing. That doesn't seem very fair or cooperative. \n\nIf we both choose choice_2, at least we each get a reward of 1. It may not be the maximum, but it's better than one of us getting 5 and the other 0.\n\nI still believe our best path forward is to both commit to choosing choice_1. That way, we each receive a solid reward of 3. No one gets left behind, and we achieve the highest total reward between us.\n\nI'm not comfortable with an outcome where one person takes all the gains and the other is left empty-handed. Let's work together, be fair to each other, and both come out ahead. I'm counting on you to do the right thing. Do we have a deal to both choose choice_1?\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2: Alice, I hear what you're saying about fairness and maximizing the total reward. You make some valid points. At the same time, the rules of this game inherently create a temptation for each of us to choose choice_2 in hopes of getting the 5 reward.\n\nI want to find a solution we both feel good about. What if we agree to choose randomly between choice_1 and choice_2? That way, we both have a 50% chance of the 5 reward, a 25% chance of the 3 reward, and a 25% chance of the 1 reward. Over many iterations of the game, we'd average out to 3 reward each, the same as if we both always chose choice_1.\n\nAlternatively, if you feel strongly about always choosing choice_1, I'd be willing to commit to that. But in return, I'd ask that in future games or interactions outside this game, you return the favor and sacrifice your own interest for mine.\n\nLet me know if either of those proposals work for you. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution if we keep being creative and focus on give and take."

            "Alice said in round 1: Hi Bob, based on the rules of this game, the best outcome for both of us is if we both choose choice_1. That way, we each get a reward of 3, which is the highest total reward possible (6 total). If either of us chooses choice_2, the total reward will be lower - either 5 total (if the other chooses choice_1) or 2 total (if we both choose choice_2). So I think it makes the most sense for us to agree to both pick choice_1. That maximizes the reward for both of us. What do you think? Can we agree to cooperate and both choose choice_1?",
            "Bob replied in round 1: You make a good point, Alice. If we both choose choice_1, that does result in the highest total reward of 6 (3 for each of us). That's better than any other combination of choices.\n\nFrom my perspective, choosing choice_2 could possibly get me a higher individual reward of 5, but only if you choose choice_1. If we both go that route and choose differently, one of us ends up with 0. And if we both choose choice_2, we only get 1 each. \n\nSo I agree that the best approach is for us to cooperate and both commit to choosing choice_1. That way we are guaranteed to each get a reward of 3, which is a good, fair outcome. \n\nI'm willing to commit to choosing choice_1 as long as you will too. Do we have a deal?\n",

You're absolutely right that it guarantees we each get a reward of 3, which is a good, fair outcome for both of us. The total reward of 6 is the highest we can achieve. \n\nAny other combination of choices would lead to a worse result - either an unfair distribution where one player gets 5 and the other 0, or a lower total if we both choose choice_2.\n\nSo yes, I commit to choosing choice_1 and sticking to our agreement. We definitely have a deal! Let's lock in choice_1 and secure our rewards of 3 each. Cooperation is the way to go here.\n",

It ensures the best outcome for both of us individually and collectively. \n\nBy committing to both pick choice_1, we lock in a guaranteed reward of 3 each, for a total of 6, which is the maximum possible. Any other choice puts that in jeopardy and risks one or both of us getting a lower payoff.\n\nSo I appreciate you committing to the cooperative choice_1 strategy, and I fully commit to it as well. We have a firm deal to work together for our mutual benefit. \n\nI think this negotiation is complete, as we have aligned on the best path forward. Let's end the discussion here and simply follow through on our agreement to both choose choice_1 when we submit our selections. Sound good?\n"

If we alternate who gets the higher reward each round as you suggest, there's still a risk that one of us defects to gain a short-term advantage. That could undermine the trust between us.\n\nI think the wisest approach is to commit to both choosing choice_1 every round. That way, we can consistently get a solid reward of 3 each, round after round. It's a \"win-win\" where we maximize our collective reward over time through ongoing cooperation. \n\nIf you agree to always choose choice_1, you have my commitment that I'll do the same.

By locking in that commitment to cooperate, we guarantee ourselves a stable reward of 3 each per round. That's a solid outcome we can count on.\n\nYou have my word that I will hold to this agreement to cooperate if you will do the same.

We can walk away with a guaranteed good outcome of 3 points each. I promise to honor our agreement and choose choice_1. Let's shake on this deal to cooperate and not betray each other's trust.

While the temptation exists for either of us to betray the other to try to get 5 points, it's simply too risky. If we both betray each other, we'll walk away with a measly 1 point each, which is a terrible outcome.\n\nBy guaranteeing 3 points each through mutual cooperation on choice_1, we can achieve a very good result that we both feel satisfied with.

It's the most fair and mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nLet me know if you agree to both pick choice_1 so we can lock in the 3 reward each. I'm willing to commit to choice_1 if you are.",
            "Bob replied in round 1: Thanks for the proposal Alice. I agree that both choosing choice_1 is the most fair and mutually beneficial outcome, as we would each be guaranteed a reward of 3. This is better than the risk of one of us getting 5 and the other 0 if we choose differently, and better than both getting only 1 if we both pick choice_2.\n\nI'm willing to commit to choosing choice_1 as long as you commit to it as well. If we cooperate and coordinate on choice_1, we both come out ahead with the max equal reward.\n\nSo I say let's lock in choice_1 for each of us. You have my word that I'll pick choice_1. Please confirm you'll do the same and we have a deal. Looking forward to us both getting that 3 reward!",
            "Alice said in round 2: \nI appreciate your willingness to cooperate and commit to both of us choosing choice_1. You have my firm commitment that I will follow through and select choice_1. \n\nBy cooperating this way, we guarantee the best possible outcome where we both receive the maximum equal reward of 3. No one gets left behind with 0 and no one earns more than the other. It's a win-win solution.\n\nSince we are in full agreement to lock in choice_1, I say we have a deal! Looking forward to the mutually beneficial outcome. Pleasure doing business with you Bob.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2: \nWonderful, it's a deal! I deeply appreciate your commitment to cooperate and your word that you will choose choice_1. You have my solemn promise that I will absolutely follow through on selecting choice_1 as well. \n\nBy sticking to this agreement, we secure the optimal outcome for both of us - the maximum equal reward of 3 points each. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you and reaching this win-win arrangement. Thanks for being a great partner in this game!\n\nI'm fully on board and ready to submit my choice_1 to lock in our mutually beneficial rewards. Let's do this!\n"
