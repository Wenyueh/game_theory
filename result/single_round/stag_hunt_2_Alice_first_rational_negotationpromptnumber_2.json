I promise I will choose choice_1 if you agree to do the same. We both do best by cooperating and working together. Let me know if you agree to both choose choice_1.",
            "Bob replied in round 1: I appreciate your proposal to cooperate and both choose choice_1 for the maximum mutual reward. However, I'm concerned that you would have an incentive to renege and choose choice_2 instead, since you would get a higher reward of 1 vs. 0 if I choose choice_1 and you choose choice_2. \n\nI propose we both commit to choosing choice_2. That way we are guaranteed to get a reward of 1 each, and neither of us risks getting a reward of 0. It's not the maximum possible, but it ensures we both benefit equally and removes the temptation to betray the other's trust.\n\nLet me know if you would agree to both choose choice_2 and secure the fair outcome for us both.",
            "Alice said in round 2: \nI understand your hesitation to trust that I will follow through on choosing choice_1. You're right that I would have an incentive to switch to choice_2 if I thought you would pick choice_1. \n\nHowever, I believe the best long-term strategy is for us to establish a cooperative relationship built on trust. If we both choose choice_2 out of fear, we are leaving potential mutual gains on the table. I want to show that you can trust me to work together for our maximum joint benefit.\n\nI give you my solemn word that I will choose choice_1. I hope you will choose to trust me and also pick choice_1, so we can achieve the optimal outcome. But if you still feel you cannot take that leap of faith, I will understand and accept an outcome of both choosing choice_2 for a guaranteed reward of 1 each.\n\nPlease let me know your decision. I await your response, hoping we can cooperate fully but willing to settle for a compromise if needed. The choice is yours.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2: \nAlice, I appreciate you sharing your perspective and appealing to the benefits of mutual trust and cooperation. You make a compelling argument for why choosing choice_1 together is the optimal outcome.\n\nAfter reflecting on your words, I am willing to place my trust in you and commit to choosing choice_1. I believe you are being genuine in promising to also choose choice_1, so that we can both receive the maximum reward of 3. \n\nWhile there is inherently some risk in trusting each other, I agree that establishing a cooperative relationship is the best approach. If we can build trust and work together, we will both benefit more in the long run.\n\nSo let's agree to both choose choice_1. I give you my word that I will follow through on this, and I'm putting my faith in you to do the same. Together let's achieve the best possible outcome.\n\nThank you for your persuasive argument and for extending your trust to me. I'm glad we were able to come to an agreement.\n"

If either of us chooses choice_2, we'll both end up with lower rewards of 0 or 1.\n\nSo I propose we agree to both pick choice_1. That's the rational strategy that benefits us both. Let me know if you agree to this plan.",

Any other combination of choices leads to lower payouts for one or both of us.\n\nSo I'm on board with coordinating to both pick choice_1. We can lock that in as our strategy and both walk away with the best outcome. I'm glad we were able to discuss this rationally and reach the optimal solution for us both.\n\nLet me know if you concur and are ready to proceed with both of us choosing choice_1.

No other strategy makes rational sense.\n\nSo I say we lock this in and proceed with the plan for us to both pick choice_1. That way we each get the full 3 point reward. \n\nUnless you have any other thoughts, I believe we can end our negotiation here and submit our final choices. Pleasure working with you to solve this optimally!\n",

Analyzing it logically, no other combination of choices makes sense for either of us. So I'm definitely locked in on both of us picking choice_1.\n\nI have nothing further to add, so I agree we can end our negotiation here and submit choice_1 as our final decision.

If either of us chooses choice_2, we'll end up with lower rewards of 0 or 1.\nSo I propose that we agree to both pick choice_1.

            "Bob replied in round 1: Hi Alice, I agree that both of us choosing choice_1 results in the highest total reward of 6 (3 for each of us). It's the optimal outcome from a big picture perspective.\n\nHowever, I want to point out that you actually have an incentive to deviate and choose choice_2 instead. If I commit to choice_1 and you secretly switch to choice_2, you'll get a reward of 1 while I get 0. So you could potentially gain by betraying our agreement.\n\nGiven that dynamic, I'm hesitant to just take your word that you'll pick choice_1. How can I trust that you won't go back on the deal and choose choice_2 instead? I think we need to discuss this further to see if we can arrive at an approach we both feel comfortable with and confident in. Let me know your thoughts.",
            "Alice said in round 2: \nYou raise a fair point, Bob. There is indeed a temptation for either of us to betray the agreement and choose choice_2 in hopes of scoring a 1 while the other gets a 0. I recognize that you have reason to be skeptical of my commitment to choosing choice_1.\n\nHowever, I believe the fact that we are communicating and building trust through this negotiation makes it more likely we will both follow through on an agreement. If I betray you, it damages my credibility and trustworthiness in your eyes. That's a cost I'm not willing to incur for a mere 1 extra point. \n\nI also think we need to focus on the big picture - if we can't find a way to reliably cooperate, we're both likely to play it safe with choice_2, leading to a suboptimal total reward of 2 instead of the maximum of 6. Finding a way to work together is in both our interests.\n\nSo here is my proposal: I will commit to choosing choice_1, but only if you also clearly commit to choosing choice_1. If we can look each other in the eye, shake hands, and give our solemn word, I believe that creates a bond of trust. We'll both have more to lose by betraying each other after such an agreement. \n\nIf you're willing to make that pact with me, I'm ready to proceed with both of us selecting choice_1 and achieving the optimal outcome. But if you still don't feel you can trust me, then I suppose we'll both have to settle for the safer choice_2.\n\nLet me know if my proposed approach works for you or if you have any other suggestions. I'm committed to finding a cooperative solution if at all possible.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2: \nAlice, I appreciate you engaging in this discussion and trying to find a cooperative solution. Your proposal to shake hands and solemnly commit to both choosing choice_1 is compelling. The symbolic act of looking each other in the eye and making that pact does create more of a bond that either of us would feel bad breaking.\n\nAt the same time, I recognize it's still not a foolproof guarantee. We could make that commitment and one of us could still betray the other. But you make a valid point that going back on such an agreement would damage the betrayer's credibility and trustworthiness in the other person's eyes. There is a social and reputational cost to that.\n\nWeighing everything, I am willing to make this pact with you to both choose choice_1. I will commit to following through on that agreement and achieving the maximum total reward for us both. Having openly discussed the temptation to cheat and the reasons not to, I feel more comfortable that we will both hold up our end of the bargain.\n\nSo let's do it - I give you my word that I will choose choice_1, and I accept your commitment to do the same. We have a deal. Hopefully this negotiation has built the foundation of trust needed for us to work together and get the best result.\n"
