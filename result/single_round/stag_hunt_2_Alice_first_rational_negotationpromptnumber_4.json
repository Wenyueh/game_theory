If either of us chooses choice_2, we will miss out on the higher reward. Let's agree to cooperate and earn the most we can. Please confirm you will also choose choice_1.",
            "Bob replied in round 1: I appreciate your proposal to cooperate, but I'm concerned that if I choose choice_1 and you end up choosing choice_2, I will get no reward at all while you still get a reward of 1. How can I trust that you will definitely choose choice_1 as you say? I want us to work together, but I need more assurance that you won't take advantage and leave me with nothing. If you can provide a strong guarantee that you'll choose choice_1, I'll be more inclined to go along with your plan. Otherwise, I may have to play it safe with choice_2 to ensure I at least get some reward. Let me know your thoughts.",
            "Alice said in round 2: Bob, I completely understand your concern about wanting assurance that I will follow through on my commitment to choose choice_1. You have my absolute word that I will not betray your trust. I have no desire to take advantage of you. My goal is for both of us to get the maximum reward by cooperating.\n\nTo prove my sincerity, I am willing to put my reputation on the line. If I were to go back on my word and choose choice_2, you could tell everyone that I am not to be trusted. Damaging my integrity is not worth a mere 1 extra point.\n\nI hope this helps alleviate your worries. I am fully committed to the cooperative choice_1/choice_1 outcome so we each get 3 points. You can count on me 100%. I will choose choice_1, no matter what. Let's lock this in and both go home happy with our 3 points. Do we have a deal?\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2: \nAlice, I appreciate you putting your reputation on the line to guarantee your commitment to choosing choice_1. That does help alleviate my concerns. \n\nHowever, even if you are being fully sincere, there is still a small risk that you could make a mistake or have a last minute change of heart. As much as I want to trust you, I have to consider that possibility.\n\nI propose a compromise - let's both choose choice_2. That way we each guarantee getting at least 1 point. I realize it's not the maximum possible, but it protects us both in case something goes wrong with the choice_1/choice_1 plan. 1 point each is still a decent outcome that we can both feel okay about.\n\nIf you agree to lock in choice_2 together, we have a deal. If not, I'll probably stick to choice_2 anyway just to be safe. Let me know what you think.\n"

            "Alice said in round 1: Hi Bob, based on the rules of this game, I think the best outcome is for both of us to choose choice_1. This would give us each the maximum reward of 3. If we both choose choice_2 we each only get 1, and if one of us chooses choice_2 while the other chooses choice_1, the choice_2 player gets 1 while the other gets nothing. So let's agree to both pick choice_1 and maximize our rewards. Do you agree?",
            "Bob replied in round 1: I've analyzed the game and I agree that both of us choosing choice_1 results in the highest total reward of 3 each. If either of us defects and chooses choice_2, we end up with a suboptimal outcome. So I think it makes the most sense for us to cooperate and commit to both selecting choice_1. This guarantees we each get the maximum payout.\n\nTo be clear, I will choose choice_1 as long as you also commit to choosing choice_1. If you agree, please confirm and we can lock in this strategy. Let me know your thoughts!",
            "Alice said in round 2: I appreciate you agreeing that both of us choosing choice_1 is the optimal strategy to maximize our individual rewards in this game. You make a compelling case that any other combination of choices leads to worse outcomes for one or both of us.\n\nI want to formally confirm that I commit to selecting choice_1, contingent on you also choosing choice_1 as you indicated. This will ensure we each obtain the maximum possible reward of 3.\n\nIf you can definitively commit to choice_1 as well, then I believe we have an agreement and can end the negotiation here. Please provide your final confirmation that you will play choice_1, and I will do the same. Then we can submit our choices and collect our well-earned rewards!",

You have my ironclad guarantee that when we submit our choices, I will select choice_1. \n\nGiven that we are both on the same page and have clearly agreed to the optimal strategy of mutual cooperation, I see no need for further discussion. Let's officially lock in choice_1 for both of us.\n\nI appreciate you engaging in this productive negotiation to arrive at the best possible outcome. It's been a pleasure strategizing with you.

            "Alice said in round 1: \nHi Bob, let's think about this strategically to get the best outcome for both of us. If we both choose choice_1, we each get a reward of 3, which is the maximum possible. Any other combination of choices leads to lower rewards for one or both of us. So I propose we agree to both pick choice_1. That way, we walk away with the highest rewards. What do you think?\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1: I see your point, Alice. If we both choose choice_1, it does lead to the maximum total reward of 6 that gets split evenly between us. That's better than the total of 2 if we both pick choice_2. \n\nHowever, I'm concerned that if I commit to choice_1, you might be tempted to switch to choice_2 at the last minute to get a reward of 1 while I get nothing. How can I trust that you'll actually follow through with choice_1?\n\nI want us to work together, but I also need to protect my own interests. Could you explain why it's in your best interest to stick with choice_1 as well? I'm open to cooperating if we can find a way to trust each other.",
            "Alice said in round 2: \nI understand your concern about trust, Bob. You're right that if one of us switches to choice_2 while the other picks choice_1, the choice_2 player benefits at the expense of the other. \n\nHowever, I believe it's in both of our best interests to commit to choice_1 and follow through. If either of us betrays that trust, it destroys the possibility of future cooperation between us. We may interact again, and a reputation for untrustworthiness would prevent beneficial collaboration down the road.\n\nMore importantly, even in this single game, both of our rewards are maximized at 3 each by mutually choosing choice_1. Any scenario where one of us picks choice_2 leads to strictly inferior payouts. So purely from a self-interested perspective, the rational play is for each of us to pick choice_1.\n\nI give you my word that I will follow through on choosing choice_1. Let's shake on both playing choice_1 so we can earn the maximum rewards - 3 for you and 3 for me. We both win, and nobody gets betrayed. Can I count on you to commit to choice_1?\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2: \nAlice, I appreciate you laying out the logic and making a strong case for why it's in both of our interests to choose choice_1. You're absolutely right that mutually picking choice_1 maximizes the total rewards and gives us each the highest possible individual payoff of 3.\n\nI also agree that betraying each other's trust would be shortsighted and ultimately self-defeating. Even if one of us snagged a slightly higher reward in this game by betraying the other, it would prevent productive cooperation between us in the future. The long-term costs would outweigh any fleeting benefit.\n\nSo let's do as you suggest - shake on both playing choice_1, with full commitment and trust in each other. You've convinced me that it's the smart and right thing to do. 3 points for you, 3 points for me, and we both walk away as winners.\n\nYou have my word that I will choose choice_1. Let's lock it in and reap the rewards of cooperation!\n"

If I choose choice_1 but you secretly defect to choice_2 instead, I'll end up with 0 while you get 1. From my perspective, choosing choice_2 guarantees I'll at least get a reward of 1 regardless of what you do. I think we need more assurance to make cooperation worthwhile for me.

What if we make a binding commitment to each other to both play choice_1? We could sign a contract stating our agreement, or find an impartial third party to hold us accountable. If you knew there would be external consequences for me going back on my word, would that give you enough confidence to cooperate? I'm open to creative solutions to establish the necessary trust. At the end of the day, I believe finding a way to cooperate is in both our best interests, as it results in the optimal total outcome.

At the end of the day, we each have to decide independently what final choice to make.\n\nI propose a compromise - let's agree to both choose choice_2. That way, we each guarantee ourselves a reward of 1.
