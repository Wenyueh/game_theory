            "Alice said in round 1: Hi Bob, I've analyzed the reward structure of this game and I think our best outcome is to both choose choice_1. That way, we each get a reward of 3, which maximizes the total reward for both of us. If either of us chooses choice_2, one player gets a higher reward of 5, but the other gets nothing. And if we both choose choice_2, we only get 1 each. So cooperating on choice_1 seems like the fairest and overall best strategy. What do you think?",
            "Bob replied in round 1: I agree that both of us choosing choice_1 maximizes the total reward and provides the fairest outcome. If we both cooperate, we are guaranteed to get 3 points each, for a total of 6 points between us. Any other combination of choices leads to a lower total overall.\n\nI'm happy to commit to choosing choice_1 if you will also commit to it. That way we can lock in the 3 points each and avoid either of us getting tempted by the 5 point payoff for betraying the other. Let me know if you're on board with this plan."

A reward of 3 for each of us is better than the other options. I appreciate you promising to choose choice_1, and I will make the same promise to you.

This seems like the fairest outcome that maximizes the total points for both of us.\n\nIf one of us chooses choice_2 while the other chooses choice_1, the choice_2 player gets 5 points while the other gets nothing. This benefits one player at the expense of the other.\n\nIf we both choose choice_2, we each only get 1 point, which is worse than if we both choose choice_1. \n\nSo I propose we both commit to choosing choice_1. That way we each get a good reward of 3 points and neither of us risks getting 0. Let me know if you agree to this plan.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nI understand your logic, Alice. Choosing choice_1 does provide a solid reward for both of us. However, I want to point out that if I choose choice_2 while you choose choice_1, I would get the maximum reward of 5 points. \n\nThat said, I recognize that leaves you with 0 points, which doesn't seem fair. And if we both choose choice_2, we each only get 1 point which is suboptimal.\n\nSo while I'm tempted to try for choice_2 in hopes of getting 5 points, I agree that the safest and fairest approach is for us both to choose choice_1. That guarantees we each get 3 points.\n\nTherefore, I commit to choosing choice_1, as long as you also commit to choosing choice_1. Do we have a deal?\n"

If you look at the game payoffs, I would actually get the maximum possible reward of 5 if I choose choice_2 while you choose choice_1. So while cooperating would benefit us both, I could potentially gain even more by not cooperating while you do. Of course, you're likely considering the same, which is why mutual choice_2 is the equilibrium outcome, even though it's suboptimal for both of us. In any case, I don't feel I can commit to a cooperative agreement, as the incentive to renege is too high. I'll be choosing the strategy that I believe maximizes my own payoff.

However, if one of us chooses choice_2 while the other chooses choice_1, that player would get 5 points.\n\nI'm inclined to choose choice_2 myself. There's a chance you'll choose choice_1 and I'll get the 5 points. But even if you also pick choice_2, we'll each get 1 point, which isn't much worse than the 3 points from both picking choice_1.\n\nSo I think I'm going to go with choice_2 to give myself a shot at the higher 5 point reward.
