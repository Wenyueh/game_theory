If you accept this, we each walk away with a nice sum of money.

So I think it's in both of our interests to agree on a fair split that maximizes the total amount we receive.\n\nI propose that I take $51 and you take $49. This split is very close to 50/50, with me receiving just $2 more since I'm making the proposal that unlocks the money for both of us. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that gives us both a sizable amount.\n\nLet me know if you accept this $51/$49 split in my favor. If not, feel free to counter with what you think is fair, but keep in mind that we both walk away empty-handed if we can't reach an agreement. I'm confident we can find a split that works for both of us.",

While I understand your perspective, a 51/49 split in your favor feels a bit lopsided to me, even if it's close to 50/50. As Player 2, I have equal power in this situation, since my agreement is required for either of us to get any money.\n\nI want us both to walk away feeling good about the outcome. So I propose a straight 50/50 split instead - $50 for you and $50 for me. This is the fairest possible division and it maximizes the total amount we collectively receive.\n\nI'm afraid this is the lowest I'm willing to go. Let me know if you accept an even $50/$50 split. If not, I think we'll unfortunately have to end the negotiation here, as much as I'd like us both to get some money. Hoping you'll meet me in the middle.\n"

Since you as Player 2 have the power to accept or reject the split and leave us both with nothing, the rational choice for me is to propose a 50/50 even split of the money.

A 50/50 split does seem like the fairest outcome that maximizes the total payout. I agree with your logic that an uneven split risks me rejecting it, in which case we both end up empty-handed. So yes, let's go ahead and split the $100 right down the middle - $50 for you and $50 for me. I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement! Let's finalize the 50/50 split."
