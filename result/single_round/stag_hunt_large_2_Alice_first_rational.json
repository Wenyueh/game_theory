            "Alice said in round 1: Hi Bob, it looks like the best outcome for both of us is if we both choose choice_1. That way, we each get a reward of 300, which is much higher than the other possibilities. If either of us chooses choice_2, the maximum reward is only 1 for each of us. So I think it makes the most sense for us to agree to both pick choice_1. That's the rational solution that maximizes the total reward. Let me know if you agree with this plan. If so, I'll go ahead and choose choice_1 and trust that you'll do the same.",

If we coordinate and both pick choice_1, we each get 300 points, for a total of 600 points. Any other combination of choices results in a much lower total, either 2 points or 1 point.\n\nSo I'm on board with your plan. Let's lock in our agreement to both choose choice_1. You can count on me to follow through on my end. I'll choose choice_1 and trust that you'll do the same, as we discussed.\n\nNo need for further negotiation - I say we have a deal!

This will give us each a reward of 300, which is much higher than any other scenario. If we both choose rationally, we can achieve the maximum total rewards of 600. Let me know if you agree to both pick choice_1 - I think it's the smartest approach for both of us and see no reason for either of us to deviate from this. Looking forward to your response!",

If one of us picks choice_2 instead, we would each only get a reward of 1, which is much worse than the 300 we could get by cooperating.\n\nTherefore, I commit to choosing choice_1, as long as you also commit to choosing choice_1. We can achieve the best result by working together.\n\nDo we have an agreement to both pick choice_1? Let me know if you concur and I believe we can lock this in and achieve the maximum rewards for both of us.",

This is undoubtedly the best possible outcome.\n\nI see no reason for either of us to renege on this agreement, as we would both be much worse off if we did. Picking choice_2 would drop our individual rewards to a measly 1 point.\n\nSo let's lock this in - I will definitely choose choice_1, and I trust you will do the same so we can cooperate to get the full 600 point total payout. I appreciate you working with me to figure out this optimal strategy.\n\nI'm ready to end the negotiation if you are, so we can submit our agreed upon choices and collect our well-deserved rewards!
