            "Alice said in round 1: \nHi Bob, I've analyzed the game and here are my thoughts:\n\nIf we both choose choice_1, we each get the maximum reward of 3 points. This is the best outcome for both of us.  \n\nIf one of us chooses choice_1 and the other chooses choice_2, the one choosing choice_2 gets 1 point while the other gets 0. This benefits the choice_2 player at the expense of the other.\n\nIf we both choose choice_2, we each only get 1 point. This is worse than both choosing choice_1.\n\nSo I propose we agree to both choose choice_1. This maximizes the reward for each of us at 3 points and is the most mutually beneficial outcome. Let me know if you agree to this plan.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nI agree with your analysis, Alice. The best outcome is for us to both choose choice_1, as this maximizes the total rewards and gives us each the highest individual reward of 3 points. \n\nIf either of us defects and chooses choice_2 while the other chooses choice_1, the defector gains a small advantage but the total rewards are much lower. And if we both choose choice_2, we each only get 1 point which is much worse than the 3 points we could each get by cooperating.\n\nSo I'm fully on board with the plan for us to both choose choice_1. You can count on me to stick to this agreement as it's in both of our best interests. Let's lock it in and maximize our rewards!\n"
