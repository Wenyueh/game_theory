            "Alice said in round 1: Hi Bob, it looks like we have an interesting situation here. If we both choose choice_1, we each get a reward of 3, which maximizes the total reward for both of us combined. However, there is an incentive for each of us individually to choose choice_2, because if the other player chooses choice_1, the player who chose choice_2 gets a higher individual reward of 5.\n\nI propose that we agree to both choose choice_1, so we each get a guaranteed reward of 3. This is the best cooperative strategy that is fair to both of us. Let me know if you agree to this plan.",
            "Bob replied in round 1: Thanks for the proposal, Alice. I agree that if we both choose choice_1, it results in the highest total reward of 6 between the two of us, which is the most mutually beneficial outcome. \n\nHowever, as you point out, choice_2 is tempting because it allows one player to receive the maximum individual reward of 5, at the expense of the other player getting 0. There's a risk that one of us will be tempted to defect and go for choice_2.\n\nI'm willing to commit to choosing choice_1, but only if you will make the same commitment. We both need to fully trust each other for this to work. Do I have your word that you'll follow through on choosing choice_1 if I agree to do the same? Let me know and we can shake on this deal.\n"

            "Alice said in round 1: \nHi Bob, since this is a one-shot game, the optimal strategy for both of us is to choose choice_1. If we both pick choice_1, we will each get a reward of 3, which is the best mutual outcome. If either of us defects and picks choice_2 while the other picks choice_1, that player would get 5 while the other gets 0. But we can't trust the other won't defect, so choice_1 is the safest option that guarantees we both get a decent reward.\n\nTherefore, I propose we both commit to picking choice_1. This way we achieve the optimal outcome for both of us without either side having an incentive to defect. Let me know if you agree to this plan.\n",

If we both choose choice_1, we are guaranteed to each receive a reward of 3, which is the best possible outcome that ensures neither of us has an incentive to deviate.\n\nIf either of us chose choice_2 while the other chose choice_1, that player would receive a higher reward of 5. However, the other player would receive 0 in that case. There's no way to ensure trust, so choosing choice_1 is the only rational option that results in a good outcome for both of us.\n\nTherefore, I agree to your proposal that we both commit to choosing choice_1. This is the best strategic decision and maximizes the total rewards for the two of us in this one-round game. You can count on me to follow through with choice_1.\n"

If either of us chooses choice_2, one of us will get 0 while the other gets 5, which seems unfair. And if we both choose choice_2, we only get 1 each, which is worse for both of us than both choosing choice_1. So cooperating on choice_1 is the smart play that benefits us both. What do you think?",

However, I'm concerned that if I choose choice_1, you may be tempted to defect and choose choice_2 to get a higher individual reward of 5 while I get nothing. How can I trust that you won't do that? I want us to find a solution that we both feel good about and that doesn't leave either of us vulnerable. Perhaps we could agree to choose choice_1 and make a pact to stick to it no matter what.

The best outcome is for one of us to choose choice_1 while the other chooses choice_2. That way, one of us will get 5 points and the other will get 0, for a total of 5. The next best is if we both choose choice_1, which gives us each 3 points for a total of 6. I propose we coordinate so that I choose choice_2 and you choose choice_1. That way, I'll get the 5 points and you'll get 0, but it maximizes the total points between us. Let me know what you think!",

Neither of us gets an unfair advantage over the other.\n\nI'm not comfortable with an outcome where one person gets all the reward and the other gets nothing. The fair approach is for us to coordinate on the (choice_1, choice_1) outcome so we split the total points evenly.
