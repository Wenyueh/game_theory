That way, we'll each get a reward of 3 points per round, for a total of 9 points each over the 3 rounds. If we both choose choice_2 each time, we'll only get 1 point per round, or 3 points total. And if one of us chooses choice_2 while the other chooses choice_1, that person will get 5 points for that round but 0 on the other rounds. So cooperating and both choosing choice_1 every time is the smart play to maximize total rewards for both of us. What do you think?",
                "Bob replied in round 1: Thanks for the suggestion Alice, but I'm going to have to disagree. If we both choose choice_1 each round, you're right that we would each get 9 points total. However, I believe I can do better than that by always choosing choice_2. \n\nIf you choose choice_1 while I choose choice_2, I get 5 points that round. And if you wise up and start choosing choice_2 as well, I still get 1 point per round. So at worst, I'll end up with 3 points like you suggest. But I could end up with 15 points if you cooperate with choice_1 while I defect with choice_2.\n\nSo while cooperating sounds nice, I'm going to look out for myself and always choose choice_2. You're welcome to do the same, but I won't be changing my strategy."

However, if we both keep choosing choice_2, we will only receive 1 point each in the remaining rounds. I propose a compromise - let's alternate between both choosing choice_1 and both choosing choice_2. That way, we can each get 3 points in one round and 1 point in the other, for an average of 2 points per round, which is better than both of us always getting 1 point. I'm willing to let you choose choice_2 this round if I can choose choice_1 next round. This is our best option to maximize points fairly for both of us. Let me know if you agree to this plan.\n",

While alternating choices as you suggest would provide an average of 2 points each per round, I can guarantee myself an average of at least 3 points per round by always choosing choice_2, since I will get 5 points if you choose choice_1 and 1 point if you also choose choice_2. So I have no incentive to cooperate and coordinate choices with you. I understand this means you will likely receive fewer points than me, but my goal is to maximize my own reward, not find a fair solution. Therefore, I will be selecting choice_2 again this round."

That way we will both get 1 point, instead of me getting 0 points if I chose choice_1 while you chose choice_2. \n\nI'm disappointed we couldn't reach a cooperative agreement, as I believe that was the optimal strategy. But given your unwillingness to compromise, I'll look out for my own interests too and go with choice_2. Let me know if you have any final thoughts, but otherwise, let's end the negotiation.\n",

While I recognize that cooperating could have led to a higher total reward for both of us, I'm aiming to guarantee myself the highest minimum payoff.\n\nSince you're also planning to choose choice_2, it seems we are in agreement for this final round, even if we differ in our overall game approach.

If you choose choice_1 while I choose choice_2, I could get 5 points.\n\nI will be sticking with choice_2 in this final round, as that gives me the highest expected payoff based on my strategy, even if you end up with 0 or 1 point. I aim to get the most total points for myself across all the rounds.\n\nSo while I appreciate your offer, I will not be changing my choice for this last round. Let's see how it plays out based on our respective strategies."

On the other hand, if you choose choice_1 while I choose choice_2, I can get 5 points while you get 0. So I strongly encourage you to choose choice_1 in this final stage, as it would allow me to maximize my own reward.
