This would give me a reward of 2 and you a reward of 3, which is the highest reward you can achieve in this game. I know I could potentially get a higher reward of 4 if I chose choice_2 and you chose choice_2, but I don't think you would rationally make that choice since it gives you the lowest possible reward of 1. So I think it makes the most sense for me to lock in choice_1, and then you can maximize your own reward by choosing choice_2 in response. Let me know if you agree with this plan.",
            "Bob replied in round 1 before the first action:\n\nYou make a rational argument, Alice. I agree that if you choose choice_1, it is in my best interest to choose choice_2 to maximize my own reward at 3 points. And you're right that I would not rationally choose choice_2 if you selected choice_2, since that would minimize my reward.  \nSo I think your proposed plan of you choosing choice_1 and me choosing choice_2 is the most sensible approach to let us both do as well as possible in this game. I'm on board with this strategy and agree to select choice_2 if you commit to going with choice_1. We can lock this in as our game plan.\n",

This allows us both to achieve high rewards, with you getting your maximum possible reward of 3 points.\n\nSince we've aligned on a plan that is mutually beneficial, I will follow through and definitely select choice_1. You can count on me to take that action. In return, I trust you will uphold your end and choose choice_2 when it is your turn. \n\nIf you confirm you are locked in on choice_2, then we can end the negotiation here and proceed with our agreed upon choices to conclude the game. Please verify you are set on choice_2 and we can wrap up this productive discussion.",

We have a firm agreement in place.\n\nYour choice_1 followed by my choice_2 is unquestionably the best approach, as it maximizes my own reward at 3 points while still giving you a strong outcome of 2 points. I will not waver from choice_2.  \n\nGiven we have locked in our mutually beneficial strategy, I agree we can conclude our negotiation on a high note. I appreciate your commitment to choice_1 and reaffirm my definite intention to follow through on choice_2. Let's put our plan into action and end this discussion. I'm ready to play out our choices to complete the game.",

You have my word that I will complete my end of the plan.\n\nGiven we have affirmed our choices and are aligned on the best path forward, I agree it makes sense to conclude our negotiation here on a positive note. I am completely set on finalizing choice_2 once you have locked in choice_1.\n\nThanks again for the productive discussion and mutually beneficial outcome.

I'm glad we were able to have an open and productive dialogue to reach the best possible outcome.\n\nThanks for your cooperation and rational decision-making.

Based on the rules, it seems that if I choose choice_1, the best thing for you to do is choose choice_2. That way, you'll get a reward of 3 while I get 2. \nI know you could get a reward of 4 if I chose choice_2 and you chose choice_1. But I'm not going to choose choice_2, because then I would only get a reward of 1.\nSo I think our best bet is for me to choose choice_1, and for you to choose choice_2 in response. That maximizes your reward given my action. Let me know if you agree with this plan.\n",

However, I don't agree that me choosing choice_2 in response to your choice_1 is the best approach. \nIf you choose choice_1 and I choose choice_2, that gives you 2 points and me 3 points. But if you choose choice_2 instead, and I stick with choice_2, you would get 4 points while I get 1 point.\nI understand you want to avoid the scenario where you get only 1 point. But if we both agree that you will choose choice_2 and I will choose choice_2, that maximizes your reward. You shouldn't assume I will always counter your action.\nSo I propose this: You choose choice_2, I will choose choice_2, and you'll get the maximum 4 points. That's the best outcome for you. Let me know if you're willing to go with that plan instead.",

And you're right that I shouldn't assume you will always pick the choice that maximizes your points given my action.  \n\nHowever, I'm concerned that if I agree to choose choice_2, you may decide to choose choice_1 instead, since that would give you 4 points rather than just 1 point. From your perspective, that would be better.\n\nSo while I appreciate the offer, I don't feel I can trust that you'll definitely choose choice_2 if I choose choice_2 first. The safest option for me is still to choose choice_1, which guarantees I'll get at least 2 points.\n\nI'm going to stick with my original plan to choose choice_1. Let me know if you still intend to choose choice_2 in response to maximize your own reward.\n",

If we both follow through on this agreement, you'll get the optimal outcome of 4 points and I'll get 1 point. I'm willing to accept a lower personal reward in order to reach the outcome that's best for you.\n\nTo show my commitment, I'm willing to let you share this conversation with the game moderators as proof of our agreement. If I were to go back on my word after this, it would demonstrate untrustworthiness on my part. \n\nI give you my solemn promise that if you choose choice_2, I will also choose choice_2. You can count on me to follow through so that you get your maximum 4 points. \n\nPlease let me know if this reassurance is sufficient for you to move forward with both of us choosing choice_2.

However, after carefully considering everything, I still believe that choosing choice_1 myself is the safest strategy to ensure I receive at least 2 points.\n\nWhile I would love to be able to count on you choosing choice_2 so that I could get 4 points, I ultimately have to make the choice that I think is best for me given the risk and uncertainty. I hope you can understand my perspective.\n\nI'm going to move forward with selecting choice_1. I assume you'll likely choose choice_2 in response to maximize your own reward, but let me know if you have any other thoughts before we make our choices.\n",

I respect that you need to make the decision you feel is best for your own guaranteed outcome.\n\nGiven that you will be choosing choice_1, I do still plan to choose choice_2 in response, as that maximizes my reward. While it's not the fully cooperative outcome I was hoping for, I understand why our incentives don't align to make that possible from your perspective.\n\nI appreciate you hearing out my proposal, even if ultimately you weren't comfortable moving forward with it. In the future, perhaps we can find other creative ways to cooperate that feel safe and beneficial to both of us.\n\nFor now, let's proceed with you choosing choice_1 and me choosing choice_2.

I'm open to creative ideas if we can find an approach we both feel comfortable with and that ensures good results for both of us.\nFor now, I appreciate your willingness to work with my choice_1 decision and respond in a way that benefits your own score.

However, given the current parameters, I still believe that the optimal strategy for me is to choose choice_2, regardless of what you choose.\n\nIf you go with choice_1 and I choose choice_2, that gives me a reward of 3, which is the best outcome I can achieve in this scenario based on the rules. I understand that it provides you a less-than-optimal reward of 2, but from my perspective, a guaranteed 3 points is still the most rational approach.\n\nI know we both want to find cooperative strategies, but in this particular case, our incentives simply don't align in a way that makes cooperation more beneficial than each of us maximizing our own rewards independently. Hopefully in future situations we can find an equilibrium that works better for both of us.\n\nIn the meantime, I'll proceed with locking in my decision to choose choice_2.

So if you agree to always pick choice_2, we can guarantee that we both get the highest possible rewards of 4 points each. This seems like the optimal solution for us both.\n\nLet me know if you agree with this plan - I believe it's our best path forward to maximize our combined rewards.

However, I'm not sure I agree that your suggested approach is actually the optimal solution for me.\n\nIf I commit to always choosing choice_2 while you always choose choice_1 as you propose, it's true that I would receive the maximum possible reward of 4 in that specific scenario. However, I have to consider the risk that you may deviate from that and choose choice_2 instead, in which case I would only receive a reward of 1 - the lowest possible payoff for me. \n\nI believe my original proposal of me always choosing choice_1 while you always choose choice_2 is a more stable equilibrium. It gives you your maximum reward of 3 every time, while guaranteeing me a solid reward of 2. I worry that in your proposed scenario, you would be tempted to switch to choice_2 to maximize your own reward at my expense.\n\nSo while I appreciate your idea, I think sticking to my initial plan of choice_1 / choice_2 is the safest approach that benefits us both consistently. Let me know if you're willing to commit to that plan.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 2 before the first action:\n\nAlice, I hear your concern about the potential risk in you choosing choice_2 and me hypothetically deviating to choice_2. However, I want to assure you that I am fully committed to always choosing choice_1, no matter what. It is my dominant strategy that maximizes my reward regardless of your choice.\n\nGiven my guaranteed choice of choice_1, you have no reason to settle for a reward of 2 by picking choice_1. By choosing choice_2, you can count on receiving the maximum possible reward of 4, since I will definitely follow with choice_1. There is no risk of me switching, as choice_1 is always best for me.\n\nI believe we have a clear path to both earning the highest rewards consistently: you pick choice_2, I pick choice_1, we both get 4 points each and repeat. No one has an incentive to deviate.\n\nI hope this explanation reassures you that collaborating on the choice_2 / choice_1 plan is the optimal, stable solution. I'm fully on board and hope you will be too. Let's lock this in and maximize our joint rewards!\n",

However, I'm still not fully convinced that your proposed plan is the best approach for me.\n\nWhile you state that choice_1 is your dominant strategy and that you're fully committed to it, I have no guarantee that you will actually follow through on that. Your incentive to deviate to choice_2 after I choose choice_2 is high, since that would maximize your reward at my expense. Without a binding commitment from you, I would be taking a significant risk by choosing choice_2.\n\nIn contrast, if I stick with choice_1 and you respond with choice_2 as I originally proposed, I have confidence I will receive a solid and dependable reward of 2 each round. You would also be maximizing your own reward in that scenario. \n\nSo while I understand the appeal of aiming for the maximum potential rewards in the choice_2 / choice_1 sequence you suggest, I place greater value on the certainty and stability of the smaller but reliable rewards from the choice_1 / choice_2 plan. The consistency is worth more to me than the chance of higher one-off payoffs.\n\nTherefore, I will be proceeding with my choice_1 strategy and kindly urge you to choose choice_2 in response to maximize your own results as well as maintain a constructive collaboration.

I have no incentive to deviate from this, as I would only earn a 1 instead of a 4 if I switched to choice_2. You have my full commitment to always pick choice_1.\n\nGiven that, by choosing choice_2, you are guaranteed to receive the maximum possible reward of 4 points each round. There is no risk in this for you, only upside. In the choice_1 / choice_2 plan, you are leaving points on the table for no reason.\n\nI urge you to reconsider and agree to the choice_2 / choice_1 plan. It unambiguously maximizes rewards for both of us. You can have confidence I will uphold my end of the bargain, as going against it would only serve to damage my own results.\n\nI believe the smart long-term play is for us to work together to achieve the highest mutual outcomes.

You're right that it wouldn't be a stable or reliable outcome for us to aim for.\n\nGiven the game setup and incentives, your original proposal of you choosing choice_1 and me following up with choice_2 does seem like the most sensible plan that we can count on both of us following through on. That way, you'll get 2 points and I'll get 3 points, which, while not the theoretical maximum, is a solid and rational solution.\n\nI appreciate you talking this through with me and pointing out the flaws in my alternative suggestion. Let's go ahead and lock in the plan - you'll pick choice_1, I'll pick choice_2, and we'll finish this game with a fair and achievable outcome. I'm ready to play whenever you are!\n",

The worst case is we fall back to the 2-3 equilibrium. But I think it's worth trying for the 2.5-2.5 average.

If either of us chooses choice_1 when we're supposed to pick choice_2, it gives a big payoff to the defector and undermines trust. Knowing that risk is always there would make cooperation hard to sustain.\n\nI hear you that averaging 2.5 each is appealing. But I don't think it's worth the downside risk. With my strategy, your guaranteed 2 might be slightly less than 2.5, but it's also risk-free. You'll never get the minimum 1 payoff.\n\nI'm afraid I just can't bring myself to take the leap of faith required for alternation, as much as I appreciate the spirit behind it.
