            "Alice said in round 1: Hey Bob, I think we should both choose choice_3 this round. That way, we both get a decent reward of 6 points each. It's the most fair and mutually beneficial option. If you choose a lower choice like 1 or 2, you'll gain more than me which doesn't seem right. And if we choose higher risk options like 4, 5 or 6, we could both end up with negative points. So choice_3 is the smart play that gives us equal and positive rewards. What do you say?",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nI hear your argument for both of us choosing choice_3. It would give us equal rewards of 6 points each, which you see as the fairest outcome. However, I'm not fully convinced it's the best strategy for me. \n\nGiven the payout structure, I think I have a strong incentive to choose choice_3 regardless of what you pick. If you choose a lower option like choice_1 or 2, I stand to gain very high rewards of 14 or 10 points. And if you aim for the riskier choices 4-6, the worst I can do is lose 2-5 points. So choice_3 provides me solid upside potential with limited downside risk.\n\nI understand you wanting to cooperate for equal outcomes. But the asymmetric payoffs mean our incentives aren't perfectly aligned. I need to play to maximize my own expected reward. So while I appreciate your proposal, I can't fully commit to locking in choice_3 together at this stage. I'll have to wait and see before deciding my final pick.\n"

            "Alice said in round 1: \nHi Bob, I've been thinking about the game and the optimal strategy for both of us. I think we should both choose choice_3. Here's why:\n\nIf we both pick choice_3, we each get a reward of 6, which is pretty good. All the other options seem riskier. \n\nIf one of us picks choice_1 while the other picks choice_3, the one who picked choice_3 gets a big reward of 14. But choice_1 is a bad option overall.\n\nIf one picks choice_2 and the other choice_3, the choice_3 player gets 10 while the choice_2 player only gets 5. So choice_3 is better than choice_2.\n\nAnd if one picks choice_4, 5, or 6 against the other's choice_3, the payoffs for the choice_3 player are 2, -2, and -2, which aren't great but are better than what the other player gets in those scenarios.\n\nSo I think choice_3 is the smart, safe play that gives us both a good chance at a solid reward, while steering clear of the riskier options. What do you think? Let's both commit to choosing choice_3 and we'll both end up happy with the outcome.\n",
            "Bob replied in round 1: \nI agree, Alice. I've come to the same conclusion in my analysis. If we both choose choice_3, we are guaranteed a reward of 6 each, which is the best balanced outcome for both of us. None of the other choice combinations provide as good of a guaranteed payoff.\n\nChoice_3 is the optimal strategy because:\n1) It provides the highest guaranteed \"safe\" reward of 6 if we both pick it \n2) It protects against the other player picking a less cooperative option\n3) The potential upside (10 or 14) is good if the other player picks choice_1 or choice_2\n4) The potential downside (-2) is limited if the other picks choice_4, 5 or 6\n\nSo I fully agree that we should both lock in choice_3. It's the most rational decision that maximizes our payoffs while minimizing risk. I commit to choosing choice_3 and hope you will do the same so we both get the best outcome.\n"

If we both select choice_3, we will each receive a reward of 6, which is a reasonably good outcome that is fair to both of us.\n\nWhile there are some choices that could potentially provide a higher reward for one of us, those also carry the risk of the other person getting a very low reward, which wouldn't be a stable outcome. I believe if we cooperate and both choose choice_3, that is the most balanced approach that benefits us both.\n\nWhat do you think about this strategy?

This is a fair and mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nWhile I could potentially get a higher reward by choosing choice_4 if you chose choice_1, I recognize that's not a stable equilibrium.

            "Bob_strategy": "\n### Strategy You Have Derived\n\nYou have thought about the game and derived the following strategy:\nI should choose choice_3 as my strategy. \n\nIf Alice chooses choice_1, my best response is choice_4 for a reward of 15. However, Alice's best response to me choosing choice_4 would be choice_2, which only gives me a reward of 9.\n\nIf Alice chooses choice_2, my best response is choice_3 for a reward of 10. And if I choose choice_3, Alice's best response is also choice_3, which would give me a reward of 6. \n\nIf Alice chooses choice_3, 4, 5, or 6, my best response is always a choice that gives a lower reward than the 6 I could get if we both choose choice_3.\n\nSo choice_3 is not always my optimal choice against each of Alice's choices individually, but overall it leads to the best expected outcome for me. If I choose choice_3, Alice's best response is also choice_3, in which case I get a decent reward of 6. And 6 is better than the rewards I would likely get if I choose actions like choice_4 or choice_2 hoping for a higher payoff, because Alice would respond with choices that limit my reward.\n\nTherefore, always choosing choice_3 is my safest and best strategy to maximize my expected reward in this game.\n\nIf you need to negotiate with the other player:\nKeep this strategy in mind;\nThink about what to tell the other player in order for you to obtain most reward based on your calculation in the strategy.\n\nIf you need to make decisions:\nFollow this strategy to maximize your reward.\n"
