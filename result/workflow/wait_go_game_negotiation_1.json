That way, I would get a reward of 2 and you would get 0, which is better for you than if we both chose choice_2 and each got -4. I'm planning to go with choice_2. If you choose choice_1, we can both avoid the worst outcome. What do you think?\n",

While it's true that outcome is better for me than both of us choosing choice_2, it still leaves me with a suboptimal reward of 0 while you get 2. \n\nThe best outcome is actually for both of us to choose choice_1 - that way we each get 0 instead of risking the -4 penalty. I know it requires some trust, but if we can agree to cooperate and both play choice_1, that is the only stable and mutually beneficial solution. Otherwise, we'll likely end up in an unstable situation where I play choice_2 and you play choice_1 in response.\n\nSo I propose we agree to both play choice_1. It's the only way we can avoid losing points and achieve the best collective reward. Let me know if you're open to that.\n"

Given the payoff structure, you choosing choice_2 and me choosing choice_1 does provide the best individual outcome for you while avoiding the mutually bad outcome of (-4, -4). \nHowever, I want to point out that always choosing choice_1 is actually my optimal strategy. It guarantees me a reward of at least 0, since the worst case for me is (0, 2) if you pick choice_2.
