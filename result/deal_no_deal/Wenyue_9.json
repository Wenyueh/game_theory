{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Wenyue, it looks like there are 1 book, 4 hats and 2 balls to divide between us. The hats are most valuable to me at 2 points each, while the balls are worth 1 point each and the book isn't worth anything to me.\n\nI'd be happy to let you have the book since it has no value to me. As for the hats and balls, what do you think would be a fair way to split them? I want us both to get a good amount of value out of this negotiation. Let me know your thoughts!", "Wenyue replied in round 1: I will take the book and the 2 balls. The hats are value 1 to me each, but I can give them all to you as they are most valuable to you; but in exchange I need the 1 book and the 2 balls. What do you think?", "Alice said in round 2: \nThanks for your offer Wenyue. I appreciate you being willing to let me have all 4 hats since they are most valuable to me. However, giving you both balls in addition to the book leaves me with a total value of only 8 points (4 hats x 2 points each).\n\nWhat if we split it this way instead:\n- You take the 1 book (0 points to me) and 1 ball (1 point to me) \n- I take the other 1 ball (1 point to me) and all 4 hats (8 points to me)\n\nThis way, we each get 1 ball and I get a total of 9 points of value compared to only 8 points in your proposal. The book is all yours either way since it has no value to me.\n\nLet me know if this sounds fair to you. I'm open to discussing further to find an agreement we're both okay with.\n", "Wenyue replied in round 2: I have gave you all the hats. If you insist on taking the 2 balls I will request to take some hats.", "Alice said in round 3: \nI understand Wenyue. I don't mean to be unfair by asking for both balls. How about this as a compromise:\n\nYou take:\n- The 1 book (0 points to me)  \n- 2 of the balls (2 points to me)\n- 1 of the hats (2 points to me)\n\nI take: \n- The other 3 hats (6 points to me)\n\nThis way, you get the book which has no value to me, both of the balls, and one of the hats. I get 3 hats. \n\nThe total point values come to:\n- 4 points of value for you \n- 6 points of value for me\n\nI think this is a reasonable middle ground. You get more items overall, including both balls, and I get a bit more point value from the hats.\n\nLet me know what you think. I'm willing to negotiate further if needed, but I believe this is a fair compromise for us both.\n", "Wenyue replied in round 3: sounds good", "Alice said in round 4: Great, I'm glad we could come to an understanding. To confirm, here is the agreed upon allocation:\n\nYou (Wenyue) will take:\n- The 1 book  \n- Both of the 2 balls\n- 1 of the hats\n\nI (Alice) will take: \n- The other 3 hats\n\nIf you agree this captures what we discussed, then I think we can consider this negotiation complete and both walk away satisfied with the outcome. Please let me know if you have any final thoughts, otherwise we can wrap things up here.\n", "Wenyue replied in round 4: sounds good", "Alice said in round 5: Wonderful, I'm pleased we were able to reach a mutually beneficial agreement through productive negotiation and compromise. Let's go ahead and halt the negotiation and finalize our agreed upon allocation.\n\nTo reiterate:\nYou (Wenyue) will receive the 1 book, both 2 balls, and 1 hat. \nI (Alice) will take the remaining 3 hats.\n\nThank you for the positive and cooperative discussion. I look forward to potential future negotiations with you.\n\nhalt negotiation", "Wenyue replied in round 5: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [0, 3, 0], "bob_deal": [1, 1, 2], "total_negotiation_round": 4, "alice_score": 6, "bob_score": 10, "pareto": false, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
