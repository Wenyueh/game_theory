{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Wenyue, based on the item values, the books are worth the most to me at 4 points each, while the hats are worth nothing to me and the balls are only worth 1 point each. I would propose that I take the 2 books, and you can have the 2 hats and 2 balls. That way, we each get items that are valuable to us. Let me know what you think!", "Wenyue replied in round 1: The most valuable item to me is book as well. I will take the bhats as they have no value to you. If you don't want the balls I can take that as well, though they are not as valuable as book. Thus I want at least one book and both hat, and 1 or 2 balls.", "Alice said in round 2: Thanks for your proposal Wenyue. I understand the books are valuable to you as well. Since there are 2 books total, how about we each take 1 book so it's fair? You can have both hats and balls in addition to 1 book, since the hats and balls have little to no value to me. That way, you'd end up with 1 book, 2 hats, and 2 balls, while I'd get 1 book. Let me know if you'd be okay with that split.", "Wenyue replied in round 2: Sounds good!", "Alice said in round 3: Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement that works well for both of us. To confirm, I will take 1 book, and you will take the other book, both hats, and both balls. \n\nIf you're all set with this arrangement, I think we can conclude our negotiation. Please let me know if you have any other thoughts, otherwise we can finalize the deal.\n\nhalt negotiation", "Wenyue replied in round 3: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [1, 0, 0], "bob_deal": [1, 2, 2], "total_negotiation_round": 2, "alice_score": 4, "bob_score": 7, "pareto": true, "envy_free": false, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
