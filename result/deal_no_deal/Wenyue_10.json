{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: There are 5 items total: 2 books worth 1 point each to me, 1 hat worth 4 points to me, and 2 balls worth 2 points each to me. So in total the items are worth 10 points to me.\nI propose that we split the items as follows:\n- I get the 1 hat (4 points) and 1 ball (2 points) \n- You get the 2 books and 1 ball (4 points total, assuming the values to you are similar)\nThis way we each get 6 points worth of items, which seems like a fair 50/50 split. Let me know what you think.", "Wenyue replied in round 1: No, I want the 2 balls.", "Alice said in round 2: \nWhat if I take:\n- The 1 hat (4 points to me)\n- 1 book (1 point to me)\n\nAnd you take:\n- The 2 balls (4 points to you, assuming 2 points each like for me) \n- 1 book (1 point to you)\n\nThis way, we still each get 5 points worth of items, which is an equal 50/50 split. The balls seem to be a priority for you, so you can have both of them in this arrangement. Would this work for you?\n", "Wenyue replied in round 2: Sounds good.", "Alice said in round 3: Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement that works well for both of us.
