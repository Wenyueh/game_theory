{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: \nHi Wenyue, based on the item values, it seems that the books and hats are the most valuable items, worth 2 points each to me. The balls are only worth 1 point each to me. I propose that I take the 3 books and 1 hat, which would give me 8 points total. You can have the 2 balls. Let me know what you think of this proposed split of the items. I'm open to discussion if you have a different proposal in mind.\n", "Wenyue  replied in round 1: The books are each of value 1 to me, which does have some value but not as valuable as it is to you. Thus you can take the books. But I need the hat and balls to compensate the loss.", "Alice said in round 2: Wenyue, I understand the books are less valuable to you than to me. So how about this revised proposal - I will take the 3 books as you suggested, which gives me 6 points. You can have the 1 hat and 2 balls, which should be worth more than 3 points to you total to make up for the lower book value on your end. This seems like a fair compromise where we both get a good amount of value. Let me know if you agree to this split.", "Wenyue  replied in round 2: Sounds good.", "Alice said in round 3: Great, I'm glad we were able to come to an agreement that works well for both of us. I will take the 3 books, and you can have the 1 hat and 2 balls. Let's halt the negotiation here since we have a deal. Pleasure doing business with you!", "Wenyue  replied in round 3: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [3, 0, 0], "bob_deal": [0, 1, 2], "total_negotiation_round": 2, "alice_score": 6, "bob_score": 10, "pareto": true, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": true}
