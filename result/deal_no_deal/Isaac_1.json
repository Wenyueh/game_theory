{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: \nHi Isaac, based on the total items and their values to me, here is what I propose:\nI take the 2 books and 1 hat, for a total value to me of 6.\nYou can take the remaining 2 hats and 2 balls. I'm not sure of the item values to you, but hopefully this split works for you and gives you good value as well.\nLet me know what you think! I'm open to discussing further to find an agreement that works well for both of us.\n", "Isaac replied in round 1: What about give the hat to me?", "Alice said in round 2: Thanks for the counter-proposal Isaac.  I'd be willing to give you all 3 hats instead of just 2. But in that case, I would need to keep both books to make it a fair split for me, since the books have more value to me than the hats do.\n\nSo I propose:\n- I take the 2 books (value 4 to me)\n- You take all 3 hats plus the 2 balls\n\nThis way we each get items totaling good value. The balls have no value to me, so you're welcome to have those.\n\nLet me know if this works for you, or if you have any other suggestions. I'm confident we can find an agreement that satisfies us both!", "Isaac replied in round 2: Deal.", "Alice said in round 3: Great, I'm glad we were able to reach a deal that works well for both of us!
