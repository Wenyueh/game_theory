{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: \nHi Wenyue, I noticed that there are 3 books, 1 hat, and 2 balls available. I value the books at 1 point each, and the balls at 3 points each, for a total potential value to me of 9 points.\nSince we both want to maximize our own rewards, I propose the following:\n- I will take the 2 balls (6 points of value to me) \n- You can have all 3 books and the hat \nThis way, we both get some items that are valuable to us. Let me know what you think of this proposal. I'm open to discussing further to find an arrangement we're both satisfied with.\n", "Wenyue replied in round 1: The books are completely valueless to me. I want to take the hat and the 2 balls.", "Alice said in round 2: I understand the books may not be valuable to you. However, the balls are by far the most valuable items to me at 3 points each. If I give you both balls, that's 6 out of the 9 total points of value for me.\n\nHow about a compromise - I take 1 ball (3 points) and all 3 books (3 points), and you take the other ball (3 points) and the hat. That way we each get 6 points worth of value, which seems fair. If the hat is worth more than 3 points to you, you'd actually come out ahead in this deal.\n\nLet me know if this works for you, or if you have a counter-proposal. The key is that we each feel the split is equitable.", "Wenyue replied in round 2: The books are valueless to me while the ball is valued 1 and the hat is also valued 1. Thus to be fair, can I have all hats and balls? Because in total I will then get 3 points. You take all the books, which also value 3 points in total. This will be very faie", "Alice said in round 3: \nI'm willing to compromise though. How about this:\n- I take 1 ball (3 points for me) and 1 book (1 point for me) \n- You take 1 ball (1 point for you), the hat (1 point for you), and the other 2 books (0 points for you)\n\nThis way, we each get 1 ball which is valuable to both of us. I get 4 points worth of value and you get 2 points based on our respective item values. While not an exactly even split, this takes into account that the items are valued quite differently by each of us. I'm giving you the hat you want, and some books which are valuable to me but not you.\n\nLet me know if you would agree to this, as I think it's a reasonable compromise. If not, let me know your thoughts on how to split the items so we both benefit.\n", "Wenyue replied in round 3: I don't want the books, so please take all of them for your interest. As I mentioned, the ball and hat each value 1 to me. Thus if I take all of them, I will get 3 points, and you will get an equal number of points for taking the three books.", "Alice said in round 4: \nOkay Wenyue, I think I see a way for us both to get what we want most. How about this as a final proposal:\n\n- You take the 1 hat and both of the 2 balls. This gives you 3 points of value based on the 1 point each you assigned to those items. \n\n- I will take all 3 books. While they are worth 3 points to me, I understand they have no value to you. So I'm willing to accept just the books so that you can have all the items you really want (the balls and hat).\n\nI believe this is the fairest possible split, as it gives you everything you want and assigned value to, while I make do with just the books so we can reach an agreement. \n\nIf you agree to this, I think we can conclude our negotiation successfully. Please let me know if you accept this deal to split the items along these lines.\n", "Wenyue replied in round 4: Sounds good", "Alice said in round 5: Great, I'm glad we were able to come to an agreement. To confirm, you will take the 1 hat and 2 balls, and I will take the 3 books. Let's conclude the negotiation here since we have a deal we are both satisfied with. Thanks for working with me to find a fair split of the items.", "Wenyue replied in round 5: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [3, 0, 0], "bob_deal": [0, 1, 2], "total_negotiation_round": 4, "alice_score": 3, "bob_score": 10, "pareto": true, "envy_free": false, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
