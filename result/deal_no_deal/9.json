{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Bob, thanks for negotiating with me. To make it fair for both of us, how about I take 2 hats and 1 ball, and you take the book, the other 2 hats and 1 ball? Let me know what you think.", "Bob replied in round 1: Thanks for the proposal Alice, but I don't think that split maximizes the total value for me. The book is worth 4 points to me, while the hats are worth nothing and the balls are worth 3 points each. \nIf I took the book, 2 hats and 1 ball as you suggested, I would only get 7 points total.\nInstead, I propose that I take the book and both balls, for a total of 10 points, while you take all 4 hats. \nSince the hats seem to be valuable to you but not to me, I think this would be a fair split that gets us each the most value. What do you think?", "Alice said in round 2: Hmm, I see your point about trying to maximize the total value for each of us. The hats are indeed more valuable to me than to you. However, your proposed split heavily favors you, as you would get 10 points worth of items and I would only get 8 points (2 points per hat). \n\nI propose a compromise - how about you take the book and 1 ball, for a total of 7 points. And I'll take all 4 hats and the other ball, also for a total of 7 points (8 points from hats + 1 point from ball, but I'll give up 2 points to make it even). \n\nThat way we each get equal value, 7 points per person. It's the fairest split I can come up with. Let me know if you agree to that and we can close the deal.", "Bob replied in round 2: \nThanks for the compromise offer Alice. I appreciate you trying to find an even split for us. However, 7 points for me is still less than the 10 points I could get from my previous proposal of taking the book and both balls.\n\nI understand you wanting it to be equal, but an exactly even numeric split may not make sense if the items are valued quite differently by each of us. The fairest outcome in my view is for each of us to get the items that we individually value the most.\n\nSince the hats are worthless to me but valuable to you, I really think you should take all 4 hats. And since the book and balls are valuable to me, I should take those.\n\nThis is my best and final offer: I take the 1 book and 2 balls, you take the 4 hats. We each get the items most valuable to us individually. Let me know if you agree and we can close the deal on this.\n", "Alice said in round 3: \nYou make a fair point that each of us should aim to get the items we value most. And I agree it's not necessarily about the numeric points being exactly equal.\n\nSince the hats are significantly more valuable to me than you, it makes sense for me to take all 4 of those. The book is your highest value item, so you should definitely get that.\n\nMy only issue is the 2 balls going to you and none for me. The balls do have some value to me, even if lower than the hats. How about I take 3 hats and 1 ball (for 7 points), and you take the book, 1 hat, and 1 ball (for 8 points)? \n\nThis way you still come out ahead in total points but I also get at least one of the mid-value items. I think that's reasonable and hopefully we can agree on that split. Let me know your thoughts!\n", "Bob replied in round 3: \nAlice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and find a split we can both feel good about. You make a fair point about getting at least one of the balls.\n\nI agree with you taking 3 hats and 1 ball, and me taking the book, 1 hat, and 1 ball. That will give you 7 points worth of items you value, while I get 8 points worth. \n\nEven though it's not a precisely even split, we both get the items most valuable to each of us individually, which I think is the fairest approach. And you still get one of the balls as a mid-value item.\n\nI'm happy with this plan if you are. Let me know if you agree and we can finalize the deal. Thanks for working with me on this!\n", "Alice said in round 4: I agree, let's go with that plan. I will take 3 hats and 1 ball, and you will take the book, 1 hat, and 1 ball. This gives me 7 points worth of items and you 8 points worth, which I think is a good compromise. We each get the items most valuable to us individually, and a share of the mid-value items too.\n\nI appreciate you working with me to find a split we are both satisfied with. I think this is the best outcome we could reach, so I'm happy to finalize the deal if you are. Let's halt the negotiation here and move forward with this agreement.\n\n", "Bob replied in round 4: I agree Alice, let's finalize the deal. I appreciate you working with me to find a compromise that gets us each the items we value most. Taking the book, 1 hat and 1 ball for 8 points is the best outcome for me, and I'm glad you'll get the 3 hats and 1 ball you wanted for 7 points. Even though it's not perfectly even numerically, we each got the items that matter most to us, which is a win-win. Thanks for the successful negotiation! Let's halt it here and move forward with the agreement.\n\nhalt negotiation", "Alice said in round 5: halt negotiation", "Bob replied in round 5: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [0, 3, 1], "bob_deal": [1, 1, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 4, "alice_score": 7, "bob_score": 7, "pareto": false, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
