{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Bob, based on the item values, it seems the books and balls are worth 1 point each to me, while the hats are worth 3 points each. Since there are 2 hats total, I propose that we each take 1 hat (worth 3 points) and then you can have the book and 2 of the balls, while I take the remaining ball. This way, we each get 4 points worth of value. Let me know what you think of this proposal.", "Bob replied in round 1: Thanks for the proposal Alice, but the books are actually worth 10 points to me, while the hats and balls are worth 0 points. So your proposal would leave me with only 1 point of value.\nI propose that I take the 1 book, which gives me 10 points, and you take the 2 hats and 3 balls, which it seems would give you 9 points total (6 for the hats and 3 for the balls). This way, we both maximize our points. What do you think?\n", "Alice said in round 2: I appreciate your counter-proposal Bob, but giving you the book alone would leave me with much less than the 9 points I could get from the hats and balls. The book is only worth 1 point to me.\n\nHow about a compromise - you take the book and 1 ball (11 points for you), and I'll take the 2 hats and remaining 2 balls (8 points for me). This gets you one more point than your proposal while still giving me a reasonably fair share. \n\nI'm willing to accept a bit less to reach an agreement that works well for both of us. Let me know if this revised split works for you.", "Bob replied in round 2: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Your revised proposal of me taking the book and 1 ball for 11 points, while you take the 2 hats and 2 balls for 8 points seems fair and balanced given our respective item values.\nI'm happy to accept this split, as it allows us both to get solid value while coming to an amicable agreement. If you're on board, I think we can conclude our negotiation successfully with this arrangement.\n", "Alice said in round 3: I'm glad we were able to find a mutually beneficial compromise, Bob. I agree that me taking the 2 hats and 2 balls (8 points) and you taking the book and 1 ball (11 points) is a fair outcome that plays to both of our interests.\n\nI appreciate your flexibility and willingness to work together to find an optimal solution. Let's conclude our negotiation on this positive note. I'm happy to move forward with this agreement.\n\nhalt negotiation", "Bob replied in round 3: Agreed, Alice. I'm also pleased we found a win-win resolution. I will happily take the book and 1 ball for 11 points while you take the 2 hats and 2 balls for 8 points as discussed. Thank you for the productive and collaborative negotiation. \n\nhalt negotiation", "Alice said in round 4: halt negotiation", "Bob replied in round 4: Yes Alice, I confirm our agreement for me to take the book and 1 ball, while you take the 2 hats and 2 balls.
