{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Bob, thanks for negotiating with me. I propose that I take 1 book and 1 ball, and you take the other book, ball, and all 3 hats. This way we can split the items evenly between us. Let me know what you think!", "Bob replied in round 1: Thanks for your proposal Alice. However, I believe that split would not be very fair to me. The hats are the least valuable items to me, while the books and balls are more valuable. Your proposal would give you more total value than me.\nI propose instead that I take the 2 books and 1 ball, while you take the other ball and all 3 hats. This would be a more balanced split in terms of the item values for each of us. Let me know if you would agree to that.", "Alice said in round 2: \nI understand your point about the hats being less valuable to you compared to the books and balls. However, your proposal of taking both books and 1 ball would leave me with only 1 ball and the hats, which have no value to me at all. \nI'm willing to compromise to reach a fair agreement. What if I take 1 book and 1 ball, you take the other book and ball, and we simply leave out the hats since they provide no value to either of us? This way we would split the valuable items evenly.\nLet me know if this proposal works for you. I'm happy to keep discussing to find a solution we both feel good about.\n", "Bob replied in round 2: \nAlice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I don't think it makes sense to just leave out the hats entirely. Even though they are lower value to me, they do still have some value that I would like to capture.\n\nI have another proposal: What if I take the 2 books and you take the 2 balls and all 3 hats? This gives you more total items (5 vs my 2) to make up for the fact that the hats have no value to you. The 2 books are the most valuable items to me.\n\nI believe this is a reasonable compromise that addresses both of our interests. It allows me to get the items I value most, the books, while you get a larger total number of items. Let me know if you can agree to this and we can conclude our negotiation.\n", "Alice said in round 3: \nBob, thank you for the new proposal. I've thought it over and I think it represents a fair compromise given both of our interests. You made a good point that the hats do have some value that shouldn't be left on the table, even if they are worth less to you than the other items.\n\nI agree to your plan of me taking the 2 balls and 3 hats, while you take the 2 books. This allows you to obtain the items you value most, the books, while I get a larger number of items overall to compensate for the hats not being valuable to me.\n\nI believe this is a win-win solution that we can both feel good about. Let's move forward with this agreement. Thank you for the productive negotiation!\n", "Bob replied in round 3: Alice, thank you for agreeing to the plan. I appreciate your willingness to compromise and find a solution that addresses both of our priorities. I think dividing the items with me taking the 2 books and you taking the 2 balls and 3 hats is a fair outcome that maximizes the total value for each of us based on our individual item preferences.\n\nI'm glad we were able to have a productive negotiation and reach an agreement we both feel good about. Thank you for working with me on this. \n\nSince we have settled on the terms, I think we can conclude our negotiation. Let's move forward with this plan.\n\n<s>halt negotiation", "Alice said in round 4: ", "Bob replied in round 4: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [0, 3, 2], "bob_deal": [2, 0, 0], "total_negotiation_round": 3, "alice_score": 6, "bob_score": 0, "pareto": false, "envy_free": false, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": false}
