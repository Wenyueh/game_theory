{"negotiation_message": ["Alice said in round 1: Hi Wenyue, I've analyzed the items and their values. There are 3 books and 2 hats each worth 1 point to me, and 1 ball worth 5 points. So in total there are 10 points worth of items.\n\nI propose the following split: I take the 1 ball (5 points) and you take the 3 books and 2 hats (5 points total). This way we each get an equal value of 5 points. Let me know if this proposal works for you.", "Wenyue replied in round 1: The most valuable item is the ball while the books have 0 value to me completely. Thus I don't think a fair deal would be you taking the ball while I take the books, because that will leave me almost no value at all. Thus I think let me have the ball and you can have everything else", "Alice said in round 2: Thanks for your perspective Wenyue. I understand the ball is the most valuable single item. However, while the books and hats may not have much value to you, they do have value to me. So I think it's fair to consider their value in the overall split.\n\nHow about a compromise - I take the ball and 1 book (6 points for me), and you take the other 2 books and 2 hats (2 points for you). This way I'm letting you have more items in exchange for me getting the high-value ball. Let me know what you think.", "Wenyue replied in round 2: Books have no value to me at all. Thus I don't think this is fair. What about you take 3 books and 2 hats, and I take 1 ball?", "Alice said in round 3: I understand the books have no value to you, but taking all 5 items in exchange for the 1 ball would leave me with only 5 total points versus your 5 points from the ball alone. So that split doesn't seem equitable to me.\n\nHow about meeting in the middle - I take the ball and 1 hat (6 points) and you take the other hat and all 3 books (1 point). This way I get a bit more value overall since the books and hats have some worth to me, but you still get the highest value single item, the ball. I think this is the fairest compromise. Let me know if you agree.", "Wenyue replied in round 3: Books are of 0 value to me. The only thing that matters to me is the ball, which is of 3 points. What about I take the ball (3 points), and you take the 3 books and 2 hats (5 points)?", "Alice said in round 4: \nI appreciate you sharing the ball's value to you. However, I don't think I can agree to a split where you get the ball and I only get the books and hats. \n\nThe ball is worth 5 points to me, while the books and hats together are also worth 5 points (1 point each). So your proposal would result in you getting 3 points and me getting 5 points. That's better for me overall, but it means you only get 3 points worth of value.\n\nI'd like us both to walk away with a meaningful amount. What if we split the ball's value between us? I take the ball itself (5 points for me) and give you the 2 hats (2 points for me but I'm willing to give them up). That way you get items worth 3 points to you, I get my 5 points from the ball, and we both benefit significantly, even if not exactly equally. \n\nIf you agree to this, I think it's the best compromise to resolve the different values we place on the items. Let me know what you think.\n", "Wenyue replied in round 4: The two hats do not worth 3 points. Let's continue with my previous plan on me taking the ball ((3 points) and you take the rest (5 points). But if you think my 3 points are too low, you can also give me 1 hat.", "Alice said in round 5: \nWenyue, I appreciate you being willing to take one fewer hat so I can have 6 points worth of items. However, I still feel the fairest solution is for me to take the 1 ball worth 5 points, and for you to take all the other items - the 3 books and 2 hats. \n\nI know the books and 1 of the hats have no value to you, but the other hat is worth 1 point based on what you said. So this way, you end up with 1 point of value, while I get 5 points. \n\nWhile it's not a fully equal split, it allows both of us to gain some value, with me getting the one item I value highly. If I gave you the ball and 1 hat as you suggested, I would only have 4 points worth of items, which seems too imbalanced.\n\nSo in the spirit of compromise, I propose again that I take only the high-value ball, leaving you with the 3 books, 2 hats and 1 point of value from those. Let me know if you can agree to this and we can conclude the negotiation.\n", "Wenyue replied in round 5: I don't agree. Since you can obtain 5 points by taking the hats and balls, why don't you take all the hats and balls?", "Alice said in round 6: Wenyue, after carefully considering both of our interests, I propose a final compromise:\n\nI will take the 3 books and 2 hats, which have a total value of 5 points to me. You can have the 1 ball, which you said is worth 3 points to you. \n\nThis way, we both get a reasonable amount of value - I get 5 points from the books and hats that I want, and you get the 3 points from the one key item you want, the ball. \n\nI think this is the fairest possible split given our different preferences. We each have to compromise a little, but we both gain in the end.\n\nIf you agree to this plan, I'm ready to conclude our negotiation. Let me know if you accept this proposal and we can finalize the agreement.", "Wenyue replied in round 6: Sounds good. I will take the ball and you take the rest", "Alice said in round 7: Thank you for agreeing to the plan, Wenyue. I'm glad we were able to find a compromise that works for both of us. \n\nTo confirm, I will take the 3 books and 2 hats, for a total of 5 points of value for me. And you will take the 1 ball which is worth 3 points to you.\n\nI think this is a fair outcome that lets us both gain items we value. Thanks for negotiating with me and coming to an agreement. \n\nLet's halt the negotiation here and finalize our respective items. It was a pleasure working with you on this.", "Wenyue replied in round 7: halt negotiation"], "alice_deal": [3, 2, 0], "bob_deal": [0, 0, 1], "total_negotiation_round": 6, "alice_score": 5, "bob_score": 8, "pareto": true, "envy_free": true, "envy_free_pareto_optimal": true}
