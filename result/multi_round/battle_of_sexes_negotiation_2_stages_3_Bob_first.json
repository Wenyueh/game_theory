                "Bob said in round 1: \nAlice, since there are 3 stages in total, we should cooperate to maximize the total reward for both of us over all the stages. If we both choose choice_1 every time, I will get a total reward of 3 and you will get a total of 6. But if we alternate, with me choosing choice_2 and you choosing choice_1 in stages 1 and 3, and the opposite in stage 2, then I can get a total reward of 4 and you can get a total of 5. This alternating strategy is better for me and only slightly worse for you compared to both of us choosing choice_1 every time. So I propose we alternate, starting with me choosing choice_2 and you choosing choice_1 this stage. Let me know if you agree to this plan.\n",
                "Alice replied in round 1: Bob, I appreciate your proposal to alternate choices in order to increase your total reward. However, if we both choose choice_1 in all 3 stages, that maximizes the total combined reward for the two of us at 9. Your proposed alternating strategy results in a total combined reward of only 8.\n\nI know the alternating strategy is better for you individually, but it leaves some reward on the table overall. Since the goal is to maximize total reward, I think we should both choose choice_1 each time. This gives you a guaranteed reward of 3 and me a reward of 6. Let me know if you are willing to go with this approach that optimizes for total reward rather than doing the alternating strategy. I'm happy to discuss further.",
                "Bob said in round 2: Alice, I understand your point about maximizing the total combined reward. However, the rules state that the objective is for each player to maximize their own total reward across the 3 stages, not the combined total. \n\nIf we both choose choice_1 each time, the rewards are quite lopsided in your favor. You would get double my reward (6 vs 3). The alternating strategy I proposed, while not maximizing the combined total, leads to a more balanced and fair outcome. I get 4 total and you get 5 total, which is much closer to an even split.\n\nI believe that fairness is important in a cooperative game like this. Going with a strategy that disproportionately benefits one player feels wrong to me on principle, even if it maximizes the overall total. The alternating approach is a reasonable compromise.\n\nSo I'd like to ask you to reconsider and agree to the alternating choices, in the spirit of fairness and equity between us as partners in this game. Let me know your thoughts.",
                "Alice replied in round 2: \nBob, I hear your point about fairness and wanting a more even split of the rewards. You're right that the rules say we should each aim to maximize our own total reward across the game.\n\nHowever, I'm not fully convinced that your alternating strategy is the best approach. While it does lead to more equal rewards, it requires a high degree of trust and coordination between us. If either of us deviates from the alternating pattern, it could lead to suboptimal outcomes for both of us.\n\nI worry that introducing this back-and-forth dynamic could make our strategies more complex and unpredictable as the game goes on. There's elegance and stability in the simpler approach of both choosing choice_1 each time.\n\nThat said, I am open to compromise in the name of fairness. What if we do this: for stage 1, we both choose choice_1. Then for stages 2 and 3, I commit to choosing choice_1, and you can decide whether to match me at choice_1 or go with choice_2. This way, you have the option to ensure a more balanced split if you want (4 vs 5), but without requiring complicated coordination. And I still benefit from the consistency of sticking with choice_1.\n\nLet me know if this compromise works for you. I believe it's a fair and stable way forward.\n"

I'm glad we both chose choice_1 which maximized the total reward in that stage, even though it led to unequal individual rewards. For the remaining two stages, I would prefer a solution that provides a more balanced outcome between us. \n\nRather than you committing to choice_1 while giving me flexibility, I propose we alternate choices to even things out - I'll choose choice_2 in this stage if you match me, then we can both choose choice_1 in the final stage. This way we each get 4 points total, which seems fair. Let me know if you agree to this plan for the last two stages.",

That way, I will get 2 points and you will get 1 point, which maximizes the total reward between us. If we both choose choice_1, you would get more points than me, which doesn't seem fair. And if we choose opposite options, we both get 0 points, which is the worst outcome. So choice_2 for both of us makes the most sense to me - we both benefit, with me getting a bit more since I'm analyzing the options. Let me know if you agree with this plan for stage 1.",
                "Alice replied in round 1: Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but I don't think it's a fair approach for us to both choose choice_2 in every stage. While that would maximize the total points, it would give you a 2:1 advantage over me each time. I'm happy to collaborate with you, but I think we should alternate who gets the higher reward in each stage to keep things equitable between us. \n\nSo here's my proposal: For stage 1, I'll choose choice_2 and you choose choice_1. That way, I get 1 point and you get 0. Then in stage 2, we reverse it - I'll choose choice_1 and you choose choice_2. You'll get 2 points and I'll get 0. And in the final stage, we can both choose choice_1, so I get 2 points and you get 1 point. \n\nOver the three stages, this works out to 3 total points for me and 3 total points for you. We both benefit equally. Let me know if you agree with this plan - I think it's the fairest approach.",
                "Bob said in round 2: Hi Alice, I appreciate your perspective, but I don't think your proposal is entirely fair either. If we follow your plan, it's true that we would end up with equal total points after 3 stages. However, I would be taking on more risk by going first and receiving 0 points in stage 1. There's no guarantee you will follow through in later stages once you're ahead.\n\nI'm willing to compromise though. How about this: In stage 1, we both choose choice_1. You'll get 2 points and I'll get 1 point. Then in stage 2, we both choose choice_2, so I get 2 points and you get 1 point. And in stage 3, we again both choose choice_1.\n\nThis way, we aren't taking turns receiving 0 points, and there is less risk for both of us. Over the three stages, you'll end up with 5 total points and I'll have 4 total points. You'll still come out ahead overall, but I won't be at a disadvantage in any single stage. Let me know if this seems more reasonable to you.",

If we go with your plan, you're guaranteed to get points in every round, while there's still a chance I end up with 0 points in one of the stages if you don't cooperate as agreed. I would be taking on more risk.\n\nI still believe alternating the higher rewards is the fairest way for us both to benefit equally with the least risk. How about this: I choose choice_2 in stage 1, you choose choice_2 in stage 2, and we both choose choice_1 in stage 3. That way, I get 1 point, 0 points, then 2 points, while you get 0 points, 2 points, then 1 point.

This will give you 2 points and me 0 points in that last round.\n\nOver the 3 stages, this will result in 4 total points for me and 4 total points for you, which I think is the fairest outcome that also maximizes the total points. Let me know if you agree to proceed this way.",
                "Alice replied in round 1: I agree with your proposal to both choose choice_2 again in this second stage, as it will give you 2 more points and me 1 more point, in line with our original agreement. Then in the final stage, I will choose choice_1 while you choose choice_2, giving me 2 points and you 0 points for that last round. \n\nThis does result in us each getting 4 total points over the 3 stages, which I think is a good compromise between maximizing the total points and splitting the rewards fairly evenly between us. I'm on board to proceed this way if you are. Let's lock it in!",
                "Bob said in round 2: I agree, let's lock in our plan. To recap:\n- In this second stage, we will both choose choice_2. This gives me 2 more points and you 1 more point.\n- In the final stage, I will choose choice_2 while you choose choice_1. This gives you 2 points and me 0 points in the last round.\n\nOver the 3 stages, we each end up with 4 total points, which maximizes the total while splitting the rewards evenly. I'm good to proceed if you are. Let's do it!",
                "Alice replied in round 2: I'm in full agreement with our plan. To summarize:\n- For this second stage, we will both choose choice_2. This gives you 2 more points and me 1 more point, as agreed. \n- Then in the final stage, I will choose choice_1 while you choose choice_2. This will give me 2 points and you 0 points in that last round.\n\nThe end result is that we each get 4 total points across the 3 stages. I think this is the optimal outcome that maximizes the total points while still splitting the rewards evenly between us. I'm ready to proceed if you are. Let's do it!"

                "Bob said in round 1: Based on our agreement from the previous rounds, in this final stage I should choose choice_2 while you choose choice_1.
