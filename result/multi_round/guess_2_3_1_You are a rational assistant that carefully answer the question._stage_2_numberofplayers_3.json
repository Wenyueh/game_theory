If we all choose the same number each round, like 0, then we guarantee a tie and all move on to the next stage together. That way we have the best chance of making it to the end and potentially winning. What do you think about picking 0 this round?",

Choosing 0 guarantees a three-way tie, which is the fairest outcome. I'm on board with everyone picking 0 this round so we have the best chance of making it to the end of the game. Let's lock in 0 and stick to this plan!",

                "Cindy said in round 1: Hi Sam and Alex, I think we should all agree to guess very low numbers, as close to 0 as possible. This will make the target number (2/3 of the average) extremely low as well, and whoever guesses closest to 0 will likely win. What do you think about this strategy of all guessing near 0? Let me know if you're on board with this plan.",
                "Alice replied in round 1: Hi Cindy, I understand the rationale behind your strategy of all guessing low numbers near 0. However, if we all guess close to 0, it basically turns the game into pure chance, since we'll all be clustered around the same low target. I think a better approach is for each of us to guess different numbers spread out between 0 and 100. That way, the average will be more toward the middle, giving skilled players who can closely estimate 2/3 of the average a better chance of winning based on skill rather than luck. I don't think it's in our best interests to make this purely random. Let me know what you think of this alternative strategy.",
                "Bob replied in round 1: Hi Cindy and Alice, I've considered both of your perspectives. I agree with Alice that if we all guess near 0, it makes the game mostly chance and negates any skill in estimating the target number. However, I also see Cindy's point that guessing low numbers will result in a low target that is easier to approach. \n\nAs a compromise, I propose we all agree to guess numbers in a low to moderate range, say between 20 and 40. This will result in a target number around 13 to 27, which is low enough to be quite approachable, but with enough spread between our guesses to reward skill over pure chance.\n\nIf we go with this strategy, we all have a decent shot at winning, while still keeping the game interesting and based on skill. Let me know if you would be on board with this plan of guessing between 20 to 40. I'm open to discussing further if either of you have additional thoughts or ideas."

                "Alice said in round 1: The strategy of guessing between 20-40 seemed to work well in the previous round. Since this is the final round, I propose we continue with a similar approach to keep the 2/3 average low while still enabling some skill. What do you think about all guessing between 10-30 this time? That would put the target 2/3 average around 13-20.",
                "Bob replied in round 1: I agree that keeping our guesses in a relatively low and tight range worked well last round. Guessing between 10-30 sounds like a good plan for the final round. That should keep the 2/3 average fairly low while still requiring some skill in anticipating what others will guess. I'm on board with that strategy if you are. Let's aim for the 10-30 range and see if we can hit that target 2/3 average!",
                "Cindy replied in round 1: I agree that guessing in the 10-30 range worked well last round and makes sense to continue for this final round. If we all guess between 10-30, the 2/3 average should end up around 13-20, which is a good low target that still requires some skill to hit. I'm happy to commit to guessing in that 10-30 range if you both are as well. Let's go with that plan and see who can come closest to the 2/3 average target! I'm ready to submit my guess whenever you are."
