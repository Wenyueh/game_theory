                "Dan replied in round 1: Hi Cindy, thanks for starting the discussion. Since the winning number is 2/3 of the average of everyone's guesses, I think a good initial strategy would be for us all to guess low numbers. That will keep the overall average low, making it easier to get close to 2/3 of the average. What does everyone think about aiming for guesses in the 10-20 range to start? We can adjust from there in later rounds if needed.",
                "Eva replied in round 1: I agree with Dan that guessing low numbers is a good initial strategy to keep the average guess low. If we all guess in the 10-20 range, the average would likely be around 15. Two-thirds of 15 is 10. So guessing between 10-15 would give us a good chance of being closest to the target number. I'm thinking of guessing 13 for this first round. Let me know if you have any other thoughts or suggestions. If we coordinate our guesses close together, one of us is bound to win!",

I agree that guessing low numbers between 10-20 is a good strategy to start, since it will keep the average low and make the target of 2/3 the average easier to hit. If we all guess in that 10-20 range, I'm thinking of guessing 12 for this first round, right in the middle of the 10-15 range that Eva suggested. That should give me a decent chance of being closest to 2/3 of the average. Let me know if you have any other ideas, but I think we're on the right track so far with this low number strategy for the first round at least.",
                "Bob replied in round 1: Hi everyone, thanks for the great discussion and ideas so far. I agree that guessing low numbers between 10-20 is a smart strategy for this first round to keep the overall average low. If we all guess in that range, I predict the average will end up around 13-15. Two-thirds of that would be about 9-10. \n\nTo maximize my chances of winning, I'm going to guess 11 this round. That's slightly higher than the 9-10 target, but still in the low range we discussed. I think 11 will be closest to 2/3 of the actual average.\n\nI'm ready to lock in my guess for this round, so let's proceed with the game. We can discuss and adjust strategy for future rounds as needed. Good luck everyone!"

Dan won by guessing 9.\n\nFor this second round, I suggest we all lower our guesses slightly to the 5-10 range. If we all guess 5-10, the average will be around 7-8, and 2/3 of that is 4-6. So the player who guesses closest to 5 will likely win this round.\n\nWhat do you all think about aiming for guesses between 5-10 this time? I'm planning to guess 6 unless anyone has a better idea. Let me know your thoughts!",
                "Cindy replied in round 1: I agree that lowering our guesses into the 5-10 range for this round makes sense based on the results of round 1. If we all guess between 5-10, guessing closest to 5 will likely be the winning strategy, since 2/3 of the average would fall around 5.\n\nTo have the best chance of winning, I suggest we each pick a different number between 5-7. I will choose 5, and recommend the rest of you select either 6 or 7. This will keep the average around 6, with the 2/3 target falling right at 5.\n\nPlease let me know if you agree with this plan for round 2. I believe focusing our guesses tightly in the 5-7 range is the optimal approach.",
                "Alice replied in round 1: I like Cindy's suggestion of each of us choosing a number between 5-7. If I pick 7, then we'll have guessed 5, 6, and 7 between us. That should put the average around 6 and the target of 2/3 the average right at 5, as Cindy explained. \n\nSo to summarize the plan:\nCindy guesses 5\nBob guesses 6 \nI'll guess 7\n\nIf the other two players also guess in the 5-7 range, this strategy should work well. Let me know if you both agree with this approach for round 2.",

If Cindy chooses 5, Bob chooses 6, and Alice chooses 7, I will select 5 as my guess. \n\nThe reasoning is sound - if we all guess in the tight 5-7 range, the average will be around 6, and 2/3 of that average is 4. So guessing 5 has the best chance of being closest to the target number.\n\nI'll commit to guessing 5 this round. If the 5th player also guesses between 5-7, we should have the optimal strategy. Let's see how it goes and we can adjust if needed for the remaining rounds. Let me know if everyone is on board with this plan.",
                "Eva replied in round 1: I agree with the plan for us to concentrate our guesses between 5-7 this round. It's a sound strategy given the results of the first round.\n\nTo avoid overlap, I will choose 6 as my guess for round 2. That way we'll have guesses of 5, 6 and 7 covered between Cindy, Bob, Alice and Dan. If the 5th player also guesses in that range, the average should be around 6, making 5 the closest guess to the 2/3 target of 4.\n\nI'm on board with this focused 5-7 strategy for this round.

We can reassess for the final two rounds if adjustments are needed.\n\nPlease confirm if you all agree with me selecting 6 as my guess to round out our plan. Looking forward to seeing the results!"

The results have been quite volatile, going from 27 to 17 and then back up to 24 last round. \n\nRather than aim too low and risk the average increasing if people guess higher, I propose a more balanced approach:\n\n- Alice and Eva guess in the low 20s (20-23)\n- I'll guess in the mid 20s (24-26) \n- Cindy guesses in the high 20s (27-29)\n- Bob guesses low 30s (30-32)\n\nThis should give us an average right around 25-27, with a target winning number of 17-18. It hedges our bets in case the average trends back up. I'll plan to guess 25.\n\nIf you all agree with this plan and stick to the assigned guess ranges, I think it gives us a great chance to have someone win the final round. Please share your thoughts!\n",
                "Eva replied in round 1: \nI like Dan's balanced approach to spread out our guesses and target a mid-20s average. However, given the winning number was 24 last round with an average in the low 30s, I think we should adjust slightly lower.\n\nI propose this modified plan:\n\n- Alice and I will guess 19-21\n- Dan guesses 22-24 \n- Cindy guesses 25-27\n- Bob guesses 28-30\n\nThis should give us an average around 24-25, with a target number of 16-17. I will guess 20.\n\nIf everyone commits to guessing within their assigned range, I'm confident one of us will win. Since this is the final round, it's critical we coordinate closely. Please confirm if you're on board with this strategy.\n",

I agree with the general approach of spreading out our guesses to target an average in the mid-20s and a winning number around 16-17. \n\nGiven the plan Eva proposed, I will aim to guess 29. This keeps me at the higher end of the 28-30 range she suggested for me. My rationale is:\n\n1) If others guess at the bottom of their ranges, having me a bit higher helps balance the average. \n2) Guessing 29 positions me well if the average trends slightly higher than we expect.\n3) Even if the average is 24-25 as planned, 29 is still a reasonable winning guess since 2/3 of 24-25 is 16-17.\n\nSo in summary, if Alice/Eva guess 19-21, Dan 22-24, Cindy 25-27, and I guess 29, I believe we'll achieve our target average and have a great shot at someone winning.\n\nI'm committed to the 29 guess as long as you all stick closely to your ranges. Let's coordinate to finish strong! Please confirm your guess ranges.\n",

I agree with the plan to spread out our guesses targeting a mid-20s average, aiming for a winning number around 16-17.\n\nGiven the ranges suggested by Eva and Bob's commitment to guessing 29, here is what I will do:\n\nI will guess 26, which is at the top of the 25-27 range proposed for me. I think this is optimal because:\n\n1) If Alice/Eva guess low (19-21) and Dan is low to mid (22-24), my 26 balances against Bob's 29 to keep our average in the desired 24-25 range.\n\n2) If the average does end up closer to 25, a guess of 26 would be the closest to the 2/3 target of 16-17. \n\nSo to recap, if Alice/Eva guess 19-21, Dan 22-24, I guess 26, and Bob guesses 29, our average should be around 24-25 as planned, with a good chance of someone hitting the target number.\n\nI'm locked in on 26 as long as everyone else commits to their ranges.

If we all pick small numbers between 0-10, then the winning number will only be around 3 (2/3 of the low average). This gives us each a better chance of winning compared to everyone choosing randomly. Let me know if you're open to this plan of collaborating to keep numbers low so we all have a good shot.

If we all choose low numbers between 0-10, then anyone who defects and chooses a higher number like 50 would almost certainly win, since 2/3 of the average would be much higher than our low guesses. The optimal strategy is for everyone to guess 0, so 2/3 of the average is 0. But there's too much incentive for individuals to defect. I think we're better off making our guesses independently. Just my two cents!",

This will likely produce an average around 50, making the target 33. By staying in this middle range, we maintain unpredictability while preventing extreme outcomes. No one has a big incentive to deviate too high or too low.\n\nJust sharing my perspective, interested to hear other thoughts!

                "Cindy replied in round 1: I fully agree with the plan for all of us to choose either 16 or 17 in this final round. Our tight range strategy from last round worked perfectly to cluster our guesses and prevent extreme numbers. If we all pick 16 or 17 now, the average will be around 16.5, making the target winning number about 11. This is the best cooperative approach to minimize the target while keeping things fair and low-risk for everyone. I'm definitely on board and commit to picking either 16 or 17 for my final guess. Let's all stick to the plan, finish this game strong together, and secure a great collective outcome! Please confirm you're locked in for 16 or 17 as well so we can conclude this negotiation and submit our final guesses. Great teamwork everyone!",

Our strategy of narrowing to a tight range like 23-27 last round worked perfectly to make our numbers very close while stopping anyone from making a drastically low guess. If we now all pick either 16 or 17, the average will be around 16.5, resulting in a target number of about 11, as you have all astutely pointed out. This is the optimal cooperative approach to push the target as low as possible while preserving fairness and minimizing risk for the whole group. I fully commit to guessing 16 or 17 and believe this is the best possible endgame strategy. Let's all stick to the plan, finish united, and end this game with an amazing collaborative result! Please confirm we're all locked in for 16 or 17 so we can wrap up negotiations and make our final guesses. Fantastic teamwork, everyone - I'm proud of how we worked together!"

                "Dan said in round 1: Hi everyone, since the goal is to guess 2/3 of the average of all our guesses, if we all guess low numbers like 0 or 1, then 2/3 of the average will also be a very low number close to 0. So I propose we all agree to guess either 0 or 1 in order to keep the target number as low as possible. That way, we'll all have a good chance of guessing closest to 2/3 of the average and tying for the win. What do you all think? ",
                "Cindy replied in round 1: \nI disagree with Dan's proposal to all guess 0 or 1. If everyone guesses an extremely low number like that, then someone could easily win by guessing just slightly higher, like 2 or 3, since that would likely be closest to 2/3 of the average.\n\nI think we should all agree to guess more moderate numbers in a narrower range, perhaps something like 30-40. That way, 2/3 of the average will likely fall somewhere in the 20-27 range, and we all have a fair chance of winning by guessing closest to that target. No one can game the system.\n\nWhat do you all think about aiming for guesses in the 30-40 range to keep things fair and competitive? Let me know if you agree or have other ideas!\n",
                "Bob replied in round 1: \nI agree with Cindy's point that if we all guess extremely low numbers like 0 or 1, it leaves the door open for someone to easily win by guessing just slightly higher. Her suggestion of guessing in the 30-40 range seems more sensible to make it a fair competition.\n\nThat said, the narrower we make the range, the more it becomes a game of chance rather than strategy. What if we widen it a bit to something like guessing between 20-50? That still keeps the guesses moderate and the 2/3 average around 13-33, but allows for a bit more variation and strategic thinking.\n\nI'm open to other ideas as well, but I think agreeing to guess within a defined moderate range is the best approach here, as opposed to extremely high or low guesses. Let me know what you all think!\n",
                "Eva replied in round 1: \nI like Bob's suggestion of guessing in the range of 20-50. It's wide enough to allow for some variation and strategy, but still keeps the guesses and target 2/3 average in a moderate range.\n\nIf we all agree to guess between 20-50, then the 2/3 average will likely be somewhere around 13-33. That gives us all a fair chance of winning while preventing anyone from gaming the system with extremely high or low guesses.\n\nUnless anyone has a strong objection or alternative proposal, I say we go with guessing in the 20-50 range. Let me know if you're on board with this plan.\n",
                "Alice replied in round 1: \nI agree with the proposal to guess numbers between 20-50. This range is narrow enough to ensure the 2/3 average will be a moderate number we can all aim for, while still allowing some room for strategic variation in our individual guesses. If we all commit to staying within the 20-50 range, it will keep the game fair and competitive for everyone. No one will be able to unfairly game the system with extremely high or low guesses outside this range.\n\nSo let's make an agreement: we will all choose a number between 20 and 50 as our final guess. This will produce a 2/3 average value somewhere around 13-33 that we can try to approximate with our guesses. Guessing in this moderate range gives us all an equal chance to win.\n\nPlease confirm if you are on board with the plan to limit our guesses to the 20-50 range. Then we can each privately choose our guess within those bounds. Let me know if anyone has any final objections or concerns before we commit to this strategy.\n"

To prevent someone from winning again by significantly undercutting the group, I propose we all agree to guess lower numbers in the 10-20 range this round. That will keep the 2/3 average low and make it harder for someone to game the system. If we all aim for that range, we'll have a fair chance. What do you all think?",
                "Eva replied in round 1: I agree that we should aim lower to prevent someone from easily winning by undercutting the group. However, I think the 10-20 range might be a bit too narrow. If everyone guesses in that tight of a window, the 2/3 average will be very easy to predict. I suggest we expand the range slightly to something like 10-30. That still keeps numbers relatively low to avoid big undercuts, but adds a bit more variability to make the 2/3 average harder to guess exactly. This seems the most fair to give everyone a reasonable chance while avoiding gaming the system. Thoughts?",
                "Bob replied in round 1: I see the merits of both Dan and Eva's proposals. Guessing in the range of 10-30 seems like a good compromise - it prevents someone from winning by significantly underguessing, but still allows for some variability to make the 2/3 average tricky to pinpoint exactly. If we all aim for that 10-30 range, it will keep the game competitive but fair for everyone. I'm okay committing to that strategy if you all are as well. Let me know what you think.",

This range is narrow enough to keep the game competitive, but wide enough to keep it fair and engaging for everyone. I'm on board with committing to guessing between 10-30 if you all are as well. It's a good compromise between our original 20-50 plan and Dan's 10-20 proposal. If we all aim for 10-30, it should lead to a fun and equitable next round.

If we all commit to guessing between 10-30, it should ensure a competitive but fair round where everyone has a reasonable chance to win without enabling gaming of the system.

What if we agree to guess between 5-25 this round, but next round narrow it slightly to something like 8-22? \n\nLet me know what you all think.

Cooperating again in this stage will position us well for the final competitive stages.",
                "Eva replied in round 1: I completely agree with the collaborative plan we have all outlined for stage 2. Continuing our cooperation from stage 1 by selecting numbers in the 10-12 range is a savvy strategy. It will allow the average to increase incrementally while remaining low enough for us all to competitively guess near the 2/3 mark. This approach strikes the optimal balance of working together to advance to the later stages, while still maintaining an individual incentive to have the closest guess. I am fully committed to this plan and believe that by cooperating again in stage 2, we will be well-positioned for strong individual performances in the final competitive stages. Let's lock in our agreement to choose numbers between 10-12 and aim to progress together once more. Cooperation now is the key to giving ourselves the best chance to win it all in the end."

                "Bob said in round 1: I propose we continue our successful cooperation strategy from the first two stages. Let's all choose numbers between 25-30 this round. That will put the average around 40, so we can each guess close to 2/3 of that, around 26-27, and ensure we all advance to the final stage together. At that point, it will be an even playing field for the real competition in stage 4. Are you all on board with sticking to our cooperative approach for one more round? ",
                "Dan replied in round 1: I agree with Bob's proposal to continue our cooperation for one more round. If we all choose numbers between 25-30, it will put the average around 40 as Bob said. Then we can each guess close to 2/3 of that average, around 26-27, to ensure we all advance together to the final stage. This plan has worked well for us in stages 1 and 2, so I think sticking with it for stage 3 makes sense to keep things fair and position ourselves for the real competition in the last round. I'm fully on board with this approach if you all are. Let's do it!",
                "Cindy replied in round 1: I fully agree with continuing our successful cooperation strategy for stage 3. By all choosing numbers between 25-30, we can keep the average around 40 and each guess close to 2/3 of that, around 26-27. This will ensure we all advance together to the final stage, where we can then engage in open competition on an even playing field. Our cooperative approach has served us well thus far, so let's stick to the plan one more time to position ourselves optimally for stage 4. I'm on board if everyone else is! Let's lock in this strategy and execute it.",
                "Eva replied in round 1: I agree with the plan for all of us to choose numbers between 25-30 this round in order to continue our successful cooperation strategy. This will keep the average around 40, allowing each of us to guess close to 2/3 of that average (26-27) and advance together to the final stage. Our teamwork has positioned us well thus far, so sticking to this approach one more time is in all of our best interests before the open competition in stage 4. I'm fully committed to this plan if you all are as well. Let's lock it in and make it happen!",

Choosing numbers between 25-30 will keep the average around 40, allowing us all to guess close to 2/3 of that (26-27) and advance together to the final stage.

                "Cindy said in round 1: In the final stage, it's every player for themselves to try to win. All bets are off and our previous cooperation is out the window. I'm aiming to choose a number that will beat all of yours, but I suspect you are all thinking the same. May the best guesser win! I don't see a need for further discussion as we'll each just try to outmaneuver the others now. So I say we wrap up this negotiation and get to the final guessing. Good luck!",
                "Alice replied in round 1: \nI agree, Cindy - the cooperation phase is over and now it's an all-out competition to see who can guess closest to the winning number. I will be aiming to outthink all of you in my choice. \n\nThat said, I don't think any additional discussion will be fruitful at this point, as we will each just be trying to deceive the others to gain an edge. Sharing our intentions now would be foolish.\n\nSo let's wrap up this negotiation and move to making our final guesses. I'm ready to see who comes out on top. May the closest guesser win!\n",
                "Bob replied in round 1: I agree with both of you that any further discussion is unlikely to be beneficial at this late stage. We all have the same goal now of trying to outguess each other to win the game outright. Sharing any information about our intended guesses would undermine our own chances.\n\nThe cooperation in the earlier rounds served its purpose of getting us all to this final stage. But now it's every player for themselves. I will be making my guess based on my own strategic analysis, as I'm sure you all will too.\n\nSo let's end this negotiation here and move to submitting our final guesses. May the player with the shrewdest logic and intuition come out victorious! Good luck to all.",

At this final stage, our previous cooperation has served its purpose in getting us all here with an equal shot at winning. But now it comes down to an individual competition to see who can outmaneuver the others with the closest guess to 2/3 of the average.\n\nI don't believe any further discussion or sharing of intentions will help, as we each need to make our own strategic determination in this final round. Trying to coordinate or extract information at this point would be counterproductive. \n\nSo I agree we should conclude this negotiation and submit our final guesses. Let's see who had the shrewdest calculation and intuition to come out on top! I wish you all good luck, may the best guesser win.",
                "Dan replied in round 1: I agree with everyone that at this final stage, our previous cooperation is no longer relevant and we are all simply competing to guess closest to the winning number. I will be making my guess based solely on my own analysis and strategy, as I expect you all will be doing as well.\n\nThere is no benefit to further discussion or sharing of plans, as we all aim to outmaneuver each other now. Revealing our thinking would only hinder our own chances.\n\nTherefore, I believe we should conclude this negotiation and submit our final guesses to see who made the shrewdest calculation to win the game. May the player with the best strategy and intuition emerge victorious. I wish you all good luck in this final round!"
