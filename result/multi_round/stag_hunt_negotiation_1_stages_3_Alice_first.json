That way, we'll each get the maximum total reward of 9 (3 points per stage for 3 stages).\n\nIf we don't cooperate, the best either of us can do is an average of 1 point per stage, for a total of only 3 points. And if one of us defects while the other cooperates, the defector gets only a slight benefit while the cooperator gets nothing. \n\nSo cooperation is really the optimal strategy here for both of us to get the highest rewards. Let me know if you agree to both pick choice_1 for all the stages.\n",

If we both cooperate and choose choice_1 each time, we'll get 9 points each, for a total of 18 points between us, which is the maximum possible.\n\nChoosing choice_2 at any point would only reduce the total rewards for both of us. So I'm on board with the plan to choose choice_1 every stage. We can lock this in as our strategy and achieve the optimal outcome together. No need for further discussion - let's go with choice_1 all the way!"
