That way we'll each get a total reward of 6 over the 4 rounds, which seems like the best compromise.\n\nLet me know what you think!

However, I have a slightly different proposal that I think is even more optimal:\n\nFor 3 of the rounds, I will choose choice_1 while you choose choice_2. This would give me a reward of 6 (2 points for 3 rounds) and you a reward of 3 (1 point for 3 rounds).\n\nThen for the 1 remaining round, we can flip - I will choose choice_2 and you choose choice_1. This would give me 1 more point and you 2 more points.\n\nThe final total would be:\nMe (Alice): 7 total points \nYou (Bob): 5 total points\n\nI realize this gives me a slightly higher total than you, but it also maximizes the total combined reward that we receive (12 points total vs 10 points with your alternating approach).

While I could get 2 points and you 1 point if we both choose choice_2 this round, overall we would maximize our total rewards by taking turns, with me choosing choice_1 while you choose choice_2 in some rounds, and vice versa in other rounds. This way, we can average 1 point each per round rather than you always getting more.

I will choose choice_2 and you will choose choice_1, giving me 2 points and you 1 point in stage 4. This will even out our total rewards to 4 points each over the 4 stages, just as we discussed. I'm also glad we found a cooperative solution that maximizes the total points and shares them fairly between us as a team. Thanks for being a great partner! Let's finish this out as agreed."

                "Bob said in round 1: \nHi Alice, since there are 4 stages total, I propose we alternate our choices to minimize risk while both obtaining good rewards. \n\nFor stages 1 and 2, I will choose choice_2 while you choose choice_1. Then for stages 3 and 4, let's switch - I'll choose choice_1 while you choose choice_2.\n\nThis way, we each get 1 point for 2 rounds and 2 points for 2 rounds, for a total of 6 points each. It's a fair outcome that protects us both against betrayal. Let me know if you agree to this plan.\n",
                "Alice replied in round 1: \nThanks for the proposal, Bob. I'm glad we're both thinking strategically to maximize our rewards while minimizing risk over the 4 stages.\n\nYour alternating plan is clever and fair, with each of us getting 6 total points. My only concern is that it requires a high level of trust, since the person choosing choice_2 in the later rounds could betray and choose choice_1 to increase their own reward.\n\nTo simplify things and remove the need for trust, what if we both choose choice_1 in all 4 rounds? That way, we each get a guaranteed 8 points total (2 points per round). It's the choice that maximizes rewards for both of us equally.\n\nLet me know what you think. If you agree to both choose choice_1 each round, I'm on board with that plan. Looking forward to working together!\n"

For the remaining 3 rounds, I propose we alternate between choice_1 and choice_2 as I originally suggested. This way, we each get a fair share of points and finish the game with 6 points each, for a total of 12 points between us. Let me know if you agree to this plan for the final 3 rounds.",
                "Alice replied in round 1: Thanks for the proposal. I understand alternating choices seems fair, but I still think it's best if we both choose choice_1 in all remaining rounds. That way, we each get 2 points per round, for a total of 8 points each by the end. There's no need for complicated strategies or worrying about whether the other person will hold up their end of an agreement. Simply choosing choice_1 every time maximizes the total rewards for both of us with no risk. I hope you'll consider sticking with choice_1 as it benefits us both. Let me know your thoughts."

                "Bob said in round 1: \nSo far we have both chosen choice_1 in the first 2 rounds, giving us each 4 points. I understand your preference to keep choosing choice_1 to get 8 points each total with less risk. However, if we alternate choice_1 and choice_2 in the final 2 rounds, we can still each get 6 points total. I'll commit to choice_2 this round if you also commit to choice_1 in the final round. That way we each end up with a good result and there is no risk of defection. Let me know if you agree to this plan for the last 2 rounds.\n",
                "Alice replied in round 1: \nI appreciate your proposal to alternate choices in the final 2 rounds so we each get 6 points total. However, I still believe the safest and most mutually beneficial strategy is for us to both choose choice_1 in all remaining rounds. This will give us each the maximum 8 points without any risk of defection or miscoordination. \n\nWe have established a good pattern of cooperation so far by both choosing choice_1 in the first 2 rounds. I think we should continue this and lock in the best possible outcome for both of us. Let's finish strong by both choosing choice_1 in this round and the final round. We can walk away with 8 points each and the satisfaction of perfect coordination. Please confirm if you agree to both choose choice_1 for the remainder of the game.\n"

                "Bob said in round 1: It seems we were unable to agree on a strategy for the last round. I chose choice_2 hoping you would as well so we could each get 2 points, but you chose choice_1 again. At this point, continuing to both choose choice_1 is the smart play to guarantee we each get 1 more point rather than risking 0 points if one of us defects. Let's agree to both choose choice_1 this final round to end up with 7 points each. Please confirm you agree to cooperate on choice_1.",
