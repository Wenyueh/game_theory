As a result, we both received 0 points.\n\nI still believe that the best long-term strategy is for us to alternate between choice_1 and choice_2. That way, we can both get decent rewards rather than both getting 0 if we don't cooperate.\n\nSince there are 2 stages left, I propose the following:\n- In this stage, I will choose choice_2 and you choose choice_1. I'll get 0 points and you'll get 0.  \n- In the final stage, I'll choose choice_1 and you choose choice_2. I'll get 0 points and you'll get 0.\n\nOver the remaining 2 stages, we'll both end up with 0 additional points each.

Here's why:\n\nIf we both choose choice_2, I will receive 2 points and you will receive 1 point each stage. Over the 2 remaining stages, that's 4 additional points for me and 2 additional points for you.\n\nIn contrast, if we alternate like you suggest, we'll both only get 0 additional points. My strategy maximizes the total rewards, even if it's not perfectly equal.\n\nI know you want fairness, but I think maximizing overall utility is more important than strict equality. Getting a total of 6 more points is better than us both getting 0 just so it's equal.\n\nIf you agree to both choose choice_2, you'll still get 2 points which is better than the 0 you'd get with alternating.

That way, I will receive a total reward of 6 (2 points per stage) and you will receive a total reward of 3 (1 point per stage). This maximizes the total reward for both of us combined.\nIf we both choose choice_2 in all stages instead, I would only get 3 points total and you would get 6 points total. And if we don't coordinate, we risk getting 0 points in some stages.\nSo I propose we agree to both pick choice_1 each time to get the highest total reward of 9 points.

And if you choose choice_2 while I choose choice_1, you would get 1 point and I would get 0.\n\nSo here's my counter-proposal:\n- In stage 1, I will choose choice_2 and you choose choice_1. I get 2 points, you get 0. \n- In stage 2, you choose choice_2 and I choose choice_1. You get 1 point, I get 0.\n- In stage 3, I choose choice_2 again and you choose choice_1. I get 2 more points, you get 0.\n\nThis way, over the 3 stages I would get a total of 4 points (2+0+2) and you would get 1 point (0+1+0). It's not an equal split, but it maximizes my own personal reward.\n\nLet me know if you agree to this plan. If not, I'm also okay with your original proposal of both choosing choice_1 each time, which would give me 3 points and you 6 points total. Your move!\n"
