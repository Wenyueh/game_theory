If we all pick the same number, then that will guarantee the 2/3 average is exactly our number. I propose we all agree to guess 0 - this keeps things simple and fair for everyone. What do you all think? Let me know if you're on board with this strategy.",
                "Dan replied in round 1: Hi Cindy, thanks for your proposal. I agree that collaborating and picking the same number is the best strategy to ensure we all win. However, I think choosing 0 is a bit too extreme and obvious. The game masters may be expecting that. What if we all agreed on a number closer to the middle of the range, like 33 or 34? That seems less conspicuous while still allowing us to match the 2/3 average if we all choose it. I'm open to other number suggestions too, but I think we should aim for the lower middle of the range. Let me know what you think!",

I agree with Dan that choosing a number in the lower-middle range, like 33 or 34, seems optimal. It's not too obvious but still allows us to coordinate. Since there are 5 players total, we would need everyone on board for this to work. I'm willing to commit to either 33 or 34 if you all are. Hopefully Bob and Alice will agree to this plan as well. Let me know if you have any other thoughts!",

If all 5 of us enter 33, it guarantees that the 2/3 average will be exactly 33, ensuring we all win.\n\nPlease reply to confirm that 33 is locked in as the consensus guess for all of us.

To confirm, I will be entering 33 as my guess.\n\nSince we still have one more round of negotiation available, I just want to do a final check to make sure no one has any last minute concerns or changes of mind. If anyone is thinking about deviating from 33, please let the group know now, as it will impact the average and could prevent us from winning. \n\nAssuming no one raises any issues, then I believe we're all set for entering 33 and achieving the win together.

                "Alice replied in round 1: I appreciate your suggestion, Bob, but I don't think everyone guessing 0 is the best strategy. If anyone deviates from 0, they would win since 0 will always be below the average. I think we should all aim to guess a non-zero number that is close to what we expect 2/3 of the average to be, based on what we think others will rationally guess. What does everyone else think? I'm open to discussing a number we can agree on, but I don't believe 0 is a stable solution.",
                "Dan replied in round 1: \nI agree with Alice that everyone guessing 0 is not a stable solution, since anyone could deviate and win. At the same time, if we all guess very high numbers, the average will be high and 2/3 of that will also be relatively high. I think the optimal strategy is for us all to agree on guessing a low but non-zero number, say between 1-10. That way, we minimize the risk of someone deviating and winning, while keeping 2/3 of the average low so we all have a good chance of being closest to it. What does everyone think about picking a number in that range that we all agree to guess?\n",

If we all guess in that range, it will keep the average and 2/3 of the average low, giving us all a good chance of being closest without much risk of someone deviating and winning.\n\nTo be more specific, I propose we all agree to guess the number 5. It's right in the middle of the 1-10 range, and if we all pick 5, then the average will be 5, and 2/3 of that is 3.33. So 5 would be the closest number to the 2/3 average.\n\nIf everyone is on board with guessing 5, I think that gives us the best shot at all tying for the win. Let me know what you all think!\n",

And aiming too high keeps the 2/3 average high. I agree with Dan and Cindy that guessing a low but non-zero number between 1-10 is optimal.\n\nCindy's proposal for all of us to guess 5 is very reasonable. With all of us guessing 5, the average would be 5, and 2/3 of that is 3.33, so 5 is the closest number to the 2/3 average in that scenario, resulting in all of us tying for the win.\n\nI'm on board with coordinating to all guess 5 in order to maximize our chances of winning and achieve the best outcome for the group. Let's lock that in as our plan unless anyone has any concerns or sees a flaw in the logic. Looking forward to us working together on this!\n",
                "Alice said in round 2: \nThanks Eva, I think your summary and reasoning makes a lot of sense. Guessing 5 seems like the optimal strategy for us all to tie and have the best chance of winning. If we all guess 5, the average will be 5, and 2/3 of that is 3.33, so 5 will be the closest number for all of us.\n\nI don't see any flaws in this logic and I'm comfortable locking in 5 as our agreed upon guess. Let's all commit to guessing 5 when we submit our numbers.\n\nSince we seem to have a consensus, I don't think we need another round of discussion, so I propose we halt the negotiation here and submit our agreed guess of 5.\n\nLet me know if anyone has any final thoughts or concerns, otherwise I think we can end the negotiation and lock in our plan to all guess 5.

However, I'm a bit worried that if even one person deviates and guesses a higher number, that person would beat the rest of us. Perhaps a safer approach is for us all to agree on guessing a low number that's not quite 0, like say 10. That way, even if someone cheats and guesses higher, the average will still be pretty low and those of us who stuck to the agreement will have a good chance of winning.

                "Cindy said in round 1: Hi everyone, to maximize the 2/3 average target we are trying to guess, I propose we all choose numbers close to 100. That way, the average will be high and the 2/3 average will be a large number we can aim for. If we all choose high numbers, we all have a good shot at winning. What do you think?",
                "Eva replied in round 1: I don't think all choosing high numbers close to 100 is a good strategy. If everyone guesses high numbers, then 2/3 of the average will also be a high number, making it difficult for anyone to win. I suggest we all choose relatively low numbers between 0-30. That way, the average will be low, 2/3 of the average will be a small number, and we all have a fair chance of guessing closest to that 2/3 average target. Choosing low numbers levels the playing field for everyone. What do you all think of that approach?",
                "Alice replied in round 1: \nI appreciate both of your suggestions, but I think we need to consider the game theory aspect further. If we all aim for high numbers near 100 as Cindy suggests, then 2/3 of the average will likely end up being in the 60-70 range, which will be hard for any individual to guess exactly. On the other hand, if we all choose very low numbers as Eva proposes, there's a risk that one player could deviate, choose a higher number, and easily win since their guess would be closest to 2/3 of the inflated average.\n\nI propose a balanced approach - let's all agree to choose numbers in the middle range, say between 30-70. That way, 2/3 of the average is likely to fall somewhere centrally in that range, around 40-50, and we all have a reasonable shot at making a close guess. No one is incentivized to deviate too high or too low. We can cooperate while still maintaining a fair competition.\n",
                "Bob replied in round 1: \nThanks for sharing your perspectives. I see the merits of each approach, but I agree with Alice that aiming for the middle range from 30-70 is the most balanced and fair strategy. If we all choose numbers in that range, it ensures the 2/3 average will land somewhere around 40-50, which we all have a decent chance of guessing near. No one is motivated to go too high or low.\n\nMost importantly, this approach fosters cooperation while still preserving a level playing field. We each maintain agency in picking our own number, but we agree to stay within mutually beneficial bounds. I believe this embodies the spirit of healthy competition.\n\nSo I'm fully on board with Alice's plan if you all are. Let's aim for the 30-70 range and may the best guesser win! Looking forward to a fun game.\n",

It strikes a good balance between cooperation and competition. If we all select numbers in the middle range, the 2/3 average will likely end up around 40-50, giving each of us a fair chance to make a close guess.\n\nMost importantly, this strategy removes the incentive for anyone to deviate too high or too low in an attempt to game the system. We can work together while still engaging in friendly rivalry.\n\nSo I'm fully supportive of the 30-70 range plan if everyone else is on board. Let's keep the game fun and equitable.

                "Eva said in round 1: Hi everyone, since our goal is to guess 2/3 of the average, I propose we all start by guessing a number between 10-20 in stage 1. This will keep the average guess relatively low while avoiding the risk of an individual overguessing. We can then adjust our guesses in stage 2 based on the stage 1 results. Let me know what you think!",
                "Alice replied in round 1: I like Eva's idea of starting with guesses between 10-20 to keep the average low in stage 1. Since the target number is 2/3 of the average, I propose we all guess numbers on the lower end of that range, like 10-12. This will result in a low average, making the 2/3 value even lower and easier for us all to guess close to. We can then increase our guesses slightly in stage 2 if needed based on the stage 1 results. Thoughts on starting with guesses around 10-12?",
                "Cindy replied in round 1: I agree with Alice's proposal to have everyone guess numbers around 10-12 in stage 1. Guessing on the lower end of the 10-20 range will result in a low average, and 2/3 of that low average will be an even lower number that we can all try to guess close to. This seems like the best strategy to have everyone guessing in a tight cluster in stage 1. Then in stage 2 we can adjust higher if needed based on the stage 1 results. But focusing on the 10-12 range in stage 1 should set us up well. Let's go with that plan unless anyone has concerns.",

Guessing on the lower end will keep the average low, and 2/3 of that will be an even lower target number for us all to guess close to. This should allow us to cluster our guesses tightly in stage 1 and be on track for a good result. I'm on board with guessing in the 10-12 range if everyone else is. We can always adjust slightly higher in stage 2 if needed based on the stage 1 outcome. But I agree 10-12 is the way to go for stage 1. Let's lock that in unless anyone objects.",
                "Bob replied in round 1: I agree with the plan for everyone to guess in the 10-12 range for stage 1. This will keep the average guess low, likely around 11, and 2/3 of that is about 7.3. So if we all guess 10, 11 or 12, we should be clustered very closely around that target value of 7.3 and maximize our chances of collectively winning stage 1. I'm going to lock in my guess as 11. Let's stick to the 10-12 plan and we should be in great shape for a win in stage 1 before adjusting if needed for stage 2. Sound good? Let me know if anyone has any final thoughts, otherwise I say we halt negotiation and submit our guesses.",

So guessing 11 should put us all very close to the target value.\n\nI agree with halting the negotiation at this point since we seem to have consensus around guessing 11.
