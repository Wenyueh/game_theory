By both choosing choice_1 as we did in the first two rounds, we will each receive the maximum possible total reward of 9 points over the 3 stages.

I reaffirm my commitment to selecting choice_1, and trust that you will do the same so we can secure the best outcome for both of us.

This would give us each 9 points total, the best possible outcome. I promise to hold up my end of the deal and always pick choice_1 if you do the same. We both win more if we work together. What do you think?",
                "Bob replied in round 1: I appreciate your offer to cooperate, but I have some concerns. If I always choose choice_1 and you choose choice_2 even once, I would end up with 0 points in that round while you get 1 point. I worry you might be tempted to take advantage of my cooperation.\n\nI would feel more comfortable alternating between choice_1 and choice_2 each round. That way we both get 1 point per round guaranteed, for 3 points each total. It's not the maximum possible, but it reduces the risk of one of us getting burned. Let me know if you would agree to that.",

If we alternate, we are guaranteed to only get 6 points total between us, leaving potential points on the table. I want us both to get the maximum reward possible.\n\nTo address your worry about me taking advantage: I give you my word that I will choose choice_1 every time as long as you do the same. We can build trust by sticking to this agreement. If either of us breaks it even once, we can go back to alternating after that. But I truly believe sticking to choice_1 is best for both of us.\n\nPlease let me know if you will agree to this plan - I promise to be fully cooperative. If we work together, we both win more. I'm committed if you are.",
                "Bob replied in round 2: Alice, I appreciate your commitment to cooperating, and I want to trust that you will follow through. However, I still have some reservations about choosing choice_1 every time. You make a good point that it could lead to the maximum total reward for both of us, but it also leaves me vulnerable if you change your mind and choose choice_2 instead.\n\nI propose a compromise: For the first 2 stages, I will choose choice_1 as long as you also choose choice_1. This will allow us to build some trust. Then in the final stage, we can both choose choice_2, so we each get at least 1 point no matter what. This way, cooperating is not an all-or-nothing proposition. We can work together for mutual benefit while still protecting ourselves individually.\n\nIf you agree to this plan and follow through on the first 2 stages, I will be fully cooperative in stage 3. Let me know what you think. I believe this is the best way to balance trust-building and self-interest for both of us."
