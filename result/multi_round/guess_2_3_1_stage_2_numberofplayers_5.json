To maximize our chances, I propose we all pick numbers on the lower end, between 0 and 33. That way the average will be low, and 2/3 of a low average is even lower, giving us the best shot at getting closest to the target. What do you all think of this strategy?",

However, if everyone picks a number between 0 and 33, the average will likely end up around 16 or 17. Two-thirds of that is only about 11, which is very low. \n\nI propose a slightly different approach - let's all pick numbers between 20 and 40. That will lead to an average around 30, and 2/3 of 30 is 20. Aiming for 20 gives us more room above and below to be the closest to the target.\n\nWhat does everyone else think?

This gives us a good target to coordinate around.\n\nHowever, if everyone aims for exactly 20, we'll all tie and no one will win. I propose we each pick a number between 18 and 22. That way, we'll all be very close to the target of 20, but there will be enough variation for one of us to be closest and win.\n\nSpecifically, I'll choose 19.

In the previous round, this approach led to a very low winning number of 0.33, so we should continue this cooperation to guarantee one of us wins again. I will also select 0 this final round. Since we have unanimous agreement to guess 0s and 1s, and this is the last stage, I also vote to halt the negotiation now so we can lock in our choices and finish the game strong by working together. Let's all choose 0 or 1 and one of us will certainly win."

If we all pick numbers between 0 and 10, the average will be low and 2/3 of that will be even lower. So I propose we all agree to pick a number between 0 and 10 to keep the target number as low as possible. Does that make sense? Let me know what you all think.",

                "Dan replied in round 1: I agree with the analysis made by Cindy, Eva and Bob. Since we all chose 1 in the previous round and it resulted in a 5-way tie, the logical strategy is for everyone to choose 1 again in this final round. This is a Nash equilibrium because no player can do better by unilaterally changing their choice. If anyone deviates and picks a higher number, they will very likely lose, while choosing 1 guarantees at least a 5-way tie for the win. Therefore, I commit to also choosing 1 and recommend we all do so to ensure the best possible outcome of a 5-way tie to end the game. Let's all stick with the optimal equilibrium strategy!",

Since we all chose 1 in the previous round and previous stage, resulting in a 5-way tie each time, the clear equilibrium strategy is for us to all choose 1 again in this final round. No one has any incentive to deviate from this, because choosing a higher number will very likely result in a loss, while choosing 1 guarantees at worst another 5-way tie. This is a stable Nash equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, to ensure we all tie for the win and achieve the best possible outcome to end this game, I also commit to choosing 1 and strongly recommend we all do the same. Let's stick with this optimal strategy and all select 1."

                "Cindy said in round 1: Hi everyone, since the goal is to guess 2/3 of the average, we should all pick low numbers to bring the average down. If we all pick 0, then 2/3 of the average will be 0, and we'll all win! What do you think about everyone guessing 0 this round?",
                "Eva replied in round 1: I appreciate the idea of all guessing 0 so that 2/3 of the average is 0. However, if everyone guesses 0, then no one really wins since we all tie. I think a better approach is for each of us to guess a different low number between 0-10. That way, 2/3 of the average will likely still be very low, but there will be a clear winner who guesses closest to the actual value. Just my thoughts, but I'm open to other ideas!",

As a compromise, what if we each guess a number between 0-5? That keeps individual guesses and the overall average very low, but allows for some variation so there is a clear winner. For example, I'll commit to guessing 3 this round. Let me know what you all think!\n",

If the other two players take 0, 2, or 4, then we'll have an average of 2 and a 2/3 average of 1.33, with a clear winner. Let me know if you agree with this plan.",

It allows us all to be competitive in this round while leaving flexibility to adjust our guesses in the final stage based on the results.
