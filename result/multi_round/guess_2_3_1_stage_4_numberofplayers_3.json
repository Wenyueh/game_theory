Since the winning number is 2/3 of the average of our guesses, I think we should all guess low numbers to keep the average, and thus the target, as low as possible. If we all guess 0 or 1, then 2/3 of the average will round to 0, so guessing 0 would guarantee a win. What do you think about all agreeing to guess 0 or 1?",

If we all guess the same low number, then it becomes random chance who wins since we'd all be equidistant from the target. I think it's better if we each guess different numbers to give ourselves a chance to be closest to the 2/3 average. I'm planning to guess a number between 25-35 to aim for a target in the 15-25 range, in case you or Carol guess higher. Let me know what you think!",

Guessing all the same number reduces the average, but guessing different numbers gives each of us a better chance of winning.\n\nAs a compromise, what if we agree to guess numbers in a narrow range, say between 20-30? That keeps the average and target number relatively low while still allowing some variation in our guesses for a closer shot at the target.\n\nI'm planning to guess 24. Let me know if you're okay with the 20-30 range and if you want to adjust your guesses based on my 24. We can decide together how to spread out our numbers in that range to collectively aim for the 2/3 target.\n"
